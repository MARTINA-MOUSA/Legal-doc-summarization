              "This concern has, unsurprisingly, not been limited to this country, as is evidenced by Conventions such as the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 1988, and the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime 1990.\n",
              "The aim of such legislation is to introduce a robust process of asset recovery into the legal system of the United Kingdom.\n",
              "The first statute in England and Wales with this aim was the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 (which was replaced by the Drug Trafficking Act 1994), which was shortly followed by the more broadly targeted Part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which in turn was amended by the Proceeds of Crime Act 1995.\n",
              "The provisions of Part VI of the 1988 Act (as amended by the 1995 Act) and the 1994 Act were repealed and replaced by the fuller provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, although the 1988 Act (like the 1994 Act) still applies to crimes committed before the 2002 Act came into force.\n",
              "These appeals are concerned only with post conviction confiscation orders.\n",
              "Different provisions apply to civil recovery independent of any criminal prosecution.\n",
              "The two instant appeals concern the proper approach for the court to adopt, and the proper orders for the court to make, in confiscation proceedings where a number of criminals (some of whom may not be before the court) have between them acquired property or money as a result of committing an offence for which all or only some of them have been convicted in the trial which led to the proceedings.\n",
              "An outline of the post conviction confiscation legislation\n",
              "The statutory exercise of asset recovery often starts before a defendant is convicted, through the medium of an order freezing all or some of his assets, but it is only after conviction that the extent of a defendants liability is finally assessed by the court.\n",
              "The role of the court at that point is to determine the recoverable amount from a convicted defendant and to make an order requiring him to pay it.\n",
              "The extent of a defendants liability for this sum is based on the value of the property which he obtained as a result of or in connection with the conduct which gave rise to the offence or offences of which he was convicted section 71(4) of the 1988 Act and section 76(4) and (7) of the 2002 Act.\n",
              "The 2002 Act has widened the potential liability of a defendant who has a criminal lifestyle.\n",
              "Such a defendant can be made liable for a recoverable amount which is based on the proceeds not merely of the criminal activity of which he has been convicted, but on the proceeds of his general criminal conduct see section 6(4) of the 2002 Act.\n",
              "A defendant has a criminal lifestyle if he falls within section 75 and Schedule 2.\n",
              "The conditions there set out include conviction of certain specified offences, such as money laundering and drugs or arms trafficking, conviction of a minimum number of other offences, and conviction of one or more offences committed over a specified period.\n",
              "In a case where a defendant has a criminal lifestyle, certain rebuttable assumptions are specifically required to be made against the defendant (eg as to the source of his wealth) by section 10 of the 2002 Act when assessing the recoverable amount.\n",
              "Seven years before the passing of the 2002 Act, a new provision, section 72AA, was added to the 1988 Act which had a rather similar purpose albeit a narrower scope.\n",
              "In order to determine the recoverable amount, the judge first has to assess the value of the property obtained by the defendant through the criminal activity in question.\n",
              "That figure is the greater of (a) the value of that property when it was obtained, adjusted for subsequent inflation, and (b) the current value of that property or of any property which has been substituted for it see sections 71(4) and 74(5) of the 1988 Act and sections 76(2) and 80(2) of the 2002 Act.\n",
              "Having arrived at that figure, the judge must assess the recoverable amount at that figure, save that sections 7(1), (2) and 9(1) of the 2002 Act provide that, if the defendant can show that it is more than the total value of his assets, the judge should assess the recoverable amount as that total value.\n",
              "The 1988 Act had similar provisions in sections 71(6) and 74(1) (3).\n",
              "Confiscation hearings can take a long time.\n",
              "In one of the two cases before us, the confiscation hearing lasted over four weeks.\n",
              "Article 6.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention) applies to all aspects of such a hearing.\n",
              "However, article 6.2 of the Convention does not, as the hearing is treated as part of the sentencing process rather than part of the criminal trial see Phillips v United Kingdom [2001] Crim LR 817, (2001) 11 BHRC 280, paras 34 36.\n",
              "In that case, the Strasbourg court rejected the contention that a mandatory statutory assumption that payments received by a convicted drug dealer were derived from drug trafficking infringed the Convention, and referred to confiscation as a weapon in the fight against the scourge of drug trafficking para 52.\n",
              "In the subsequent case of Grayson v United Kingdom [2009] Crim LR 200, (2008) 48 EHRR 722, the Strasbourg court held that imposing a reverse burden of proof on a convicted defendant in relation to certain issues at the confiscation hearing also did not infringe the Convention see especially para 49.\n",
              "In R v Silcock and Levin [2004] EWCA Crim 408; [2004] 2 Cr App R (S) 61,\n",
              "para 60 and R v Clipston [2011] EWCA Crim 446; [2011] 2 Cr App R (S) 101, paras 57 60, the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division explained that the character of a confiscation hearing was more civil than criminal.\n",
              "Thus, the judge can decide issues on the balance of probabilities, compel the defendant to disclose documents, draw adverse inferences from the absence of evidence, and rely on hearsay evidence.\n",
              "In our view, this is plainly right, both as a matter of principle and in the light of section 71(7A) of the 1988 Act and section 6(7) of the 2002 Act.\n",
              "Once the recoverable amount is determined, the judge should make an order requiring the defendant to pay it within a period which (under section 75(1) of the 1988 Act) would be the same as for a fine, or (under section 11 of the 2002 Act) must be specified by the court but cannot exceed twelve months.\n",
              "If and to the extent that the recoverable amount is not paid, the defendant must serve a term of imprisonment in default, fixed by the judge by reference to section 139(4) of the Powers of the Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 see section 75(2) of the 1988 Act and sections 35 39 of the 2002 Act.\n",
              "Serving that default term does not, however, remove the liability to pay see section 75(5A) of the 1988 Act and section 38(5) of the 2002 Act.\n",
              "Confiscation hearings may take place before sentencing, or can be and often are postponed, but the postponement should not be for a period of more than six months (under the 1988 Act) or two years (under the 2002 Act) from the date of the conviction unless there are exceptional circumstances see section 72A of the 1988 Act and section 14 of the 2002 Act.\n",
              "The facts giving rise to these two appeals\n",
              "In the first appeal, the appellants, Shakeel Ahmad and Syed Ahmed (the Ahmad defendants) were convicted by a jury of fraud and sentenced by His Honour Judge Alexander QC to seven years in prison.\n",
              "The fraud was a so called carousel fraud, which involves criminally misusing the collection system of Value Added Tax (VAT) to extract money from the revenue authorities.\n",
              "The Ahmad defendants had been the sole directors and shareholders of a company known as MST, which dealt in computer central processing units (CPUs), which were zero rated for VAT purposes on import to the United Kingdom.\n",
              "The fraud involved five companies in Ireland, which, in a total of 32 transactions during April 2002, purported to export large quantities of CPUs to five companies in the UK, each of whom was either a registered company which went missing or a genuine company the identity of which was hijacked by the fraudsters.\n",
              "The missing trader then ostensibly sold the goods to a company known as GW224, which then sold the goods on to MST.\n",
              "GW224 was a company interposed to make it more difficult for the authorities to identify the fraud.\n",
              "On paper, the missing trader sold the goods to GW224 at a loss enabling everyone else in the supply chain ostensibly to sell on at a profit.\n",
              "The missing trader issued a VAT invoice to GW224 enabling it to deduct the amount shown as input tax from the amount due from GW224 to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in respect of output tax on the onwards sale to MST.\n",
              "MST then sold the goods on to an exporting company, for an amount which included VAT.\n",
              "The exporting company then exported the goods back to the company in Ireland which had originally sold the goods.\n",
              "In many cases the whole chain of transactions took place on the same day.\n",
              "No VAT was payable on the export.\n",
              "The exporting company however then reclaimed the VAT which it had paid to MST.\n",
              "The amount of the VAT which was fraudulently reclaimed by the exporting company was about 12.6m, which represented HMRCs loss as a result of the fraud.\n",
              "If the transactions had been genuine and there had been no missing trader then there would have been no loss to HMRC.\n",
              "After the Ahmad defendants had been convicted, there was a confiscation hearing, pursuant to the 1988 Act, which lasted some thirty days before Flaux J.\n",
              "In a full and careful judgment, he concluded that MST made a. Payments directly to one of the Irish companies, including the first payment made in order to prime the pump for the fraud; b. Payments to GW224 to prime the pump; and c. Payments to cashing up accounts: entities which allowed their (genuine) accounts to be used for converting the proceeds of the fraud into cash or to buy gold bullion.\n",
              "None of the cash or gold bullion could be traced.\n",
              "The judge found that the vast majority of MSTs trading over the relevant period was fraudulent and that the Ahmad defendants had used MST for the purpose of crime.\n",
              "He also held that they controlled its property, and that as between themselves they held everything in its name jointly and equally.\n",
              "There was no evidence as to the means by which the Ahmad defendants had extracted their gains from the fraud, nor was there any evidence as to the number of other participants in the fraud.\n",
              "The judge said that nothing which either of the Ahmad defendants said could be relied upon to be truthful.\n",
              "They had deliberately flouted the restraint order by disposing of frozen assets.\n",
              "They had advanced repeated false allegations against their own lawyers, which the judge described as outrageous.\n",
              "They had abused the proceedings by deliberate time wasting and irrelevance.\n",
              "Both Ahmad defendants, Flaux J said, were unscrupulous and deeply mendacious.\n",
              "The Ahmad defendants contended that they had obtained no benefit at all and that MST had merely acted as an intermediary for others.\n",
              "The judge rejected that evidence.\n",
              "He concluded that, for the purposes of the 1988 Act, the benefit obtained by MST was the benefit obtained by the Ahmad defendants jointly.\n",
              "He assessed that benefit at a very large figure for which the Crown no longer contends.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal determined that benefit to be the loss suffered by HMRC, namely 12.6m, which translated to 16.1m when adjusted for inflation.\n",
              "The judge rejected the defendants evidence that the available amount was less, and that was the recoverable amount specified payable by each of them in the confiscation orders made by the Court of Appeal.\n",
              "As Hooper LJ put it, in reliance on what Lord Bingham said in R v May [2008] UKHL 28; [2008] AC 1028, para 43, where a benefit is obtained jointly, each of the joint beneficiaries has obtained the whole of the benefit and may properly be ordered to pay a sum equivalent to the whole of it, unless the circumstances were such that such a decision would infringe article 1 of the first protocol to the Convention (A1P1) see [2012] EWCA Crim 391, [2012] 1 WLR 2335, para 21.\n",
              "The default prison terms set by the judge were upheld at ten years in each case.\n",
              "In the second appeal, the three appellants, Michael Fields, Mitesh Sanghani and Karamjit Sagoo (the Fields defendants), and a fourth man, Wasim Rajput, were found guilty by a jury of conspiracy to defraud over a period between January and June 2005.\n",
              "The Fields defendants were each sentenced to five years in prison, and Mr Rajput was imprisoned for thirty months.\n",
              "The fraud was said by the prosecution to involve two other men who were acquitted, and one other man as to whose guilt the jury was unable to agree.\n",
              "The Fields defendants were described by the trial judge, His Honour Judge Carr, as being at the heart of the fraud, and that it was a joint operation between them, whereas Mr Rajputs position was accepted by the judge as being more peripheral.\n",
              "The fraudulent conspiracy involved the use of a company called Mercury Distributions Ltd (MDL), whose published accounts for the years 2002/3 and 2003/4 falsely recorded that it had over 1m in fixed assets.\n",
              "It was appreciated that potential customers of MDL would be likely to check the accounts before committing themselves to doing business with it and granting credit.\n",
              "Premises were obtained by Mr Sagoo in February 2005, with the assistance of false trade references.\n",
              "From then on, MDL engaged in fraudulent trading, applying to buy goods or obtain services on credit, which resulted in credit checks which indicated that it was financially healthy.\n",
              "As a result, credit agreements were approved, and goods and services were supplied by around 35 businesses, but no payments were ever made and, at least for the most part, the goods disappeared.\n",
              "The Fields defendants were each instrumental in this fraudulent activity.\n",
              "Mr Rajput was much less closely involved.\n",
              "In the subsequent confiscation proceedings, which were described by Davis LJ as protracted, it appears that the evidence on behalf of the Fields defendants was attenuated and misleading.\n",
              "The judge found that the total benefit, in the form of goods and services supplied, arising from the conspiracy was about 1.4m, which had been acquired jointly by the Fields defendants.\n",
              "Having adjusted that figure upwards to about 1.6m to allow for inflation, the judge rejected the contention that this was more than the available amount, and decided (subject to an irrelevant point) that confiscation orders under the 2002 Act should be made against each of the Fields defendants for the whole of this amount (with a default period of imprisonment of seven years).\n",
              "As to Mr Rajput, he was found to have received 12,000 for his involvement, but only a nominal order was made against him because he established that he had no assets.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal upheld the confiscation orders made against the Fields defendants.\n",
              "In his judgment, Davis LJ rejected the contention that the defendants had beneficial interests limited to one third each of the 1.6m and held that it was right that each should be individually liable for the whole of that sum.\n",
              "He did so in the light of (i) authority, in particular the decision of the House of Lords in May, and (ii) on the grounds of strong policy objections to the court recognising beneficial interests inter se amongst those who had jointly obtained the whole of the relevant property.\n",
              "The court held that [s]ection 79(3) of the 2002 Act is to be taken as, generally speaking, extending to making allowance for lawfully subsisting prior interests of other persons: not to the asserted beneficial interests of co conspirators whose very criminality has caused the relevant property to be obtained jointly in the first place. see [2013] EWCA Crim 2042, [2014] 2 WLR 233, paras 36 46.\n",
              "The issues in these appeals\n",
              "In neither appeal do the appellant defendants challenge the quantification of the aggregate recoverable amount, (16.1m in the case of the Ahmad defendants and 1.6m in the case of the Fields defendants) or the finding that they obtained that amount jointly.\n",
              "What they do challenge is the decision of the Court of Appeal that each of the appellants should be separately liable for the whole of that amount.\n",
              "They contend that such an outcome is arbitrary and oppressive.\n",
              "However, the preferred approach of the two groups of appellants was different.\n",
              "For the Ahmad defendants, Mr Mitchell QC accepted that it was appropriate for each of the two appellants to be liable for 16.1m, but contended that their liability should be treated as joint and several in accordance with normal common law principles, so that they should be required to pay that sum between them.\n",
              "In other words, if, for instance, Mr Ahmad paid 12.6m, then both he and Mr Ahmed would then continue to be liable, but only for 3.5m, and if one or both (between them) then paid the 3.5m, there would be no further liability on either of them.\n",
              "Mr Owen QC, for the Fields defendants, raised a more fundamental challenge to the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal, and said that it was wrong for each of the Fields defendants to be liable for 1.6m.\n",
              "He argued that the courts below ought to have apportioned the benefit between the three Fields defendants, and therefore assessed their individual liability accordingly.\n",
              "Thus, subject to any liability being attributed to other persons, and subject to any reason to think that they should not be equally liable, the Fields defendants should each be liable for 533,333.\n",
              "The issue raised by these appeals can be encapsulated in the question: when a number of people (all or only some of whom are before the court) have been involved in the commission of a crime which resulted in property being acquired by them together, what is the proper approach for the court to adopt, and the proper orders for the court to make, in confiscation hearings?\n",
              "The resolution of the issue must depend on the interpretation of the relevant legislation, taking into account (i) previous case law (including a number of decisions, more than one at the highest level, which support the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal in the instant two cases), and (ii) the practical difficulties faced by any judge carrying out a confiscation hearing.\n",
              "The centrally relevant statutory provisions\n",
              "Although the language of the 1988 and 2002 Acts is not identical, there is no material difference between them for present purposes and it is convenient to consider that issue in the context of the 2002 Act, which now applies to the great majority of cases which come before the courts.\n",
              "The central provisions are sections 6 (making an order), 7 (recoverable amount), 9 (available amount), 76 (conduct and benefit), 79 and 80 (value) and 84 (property).\n",
              "Section 6(5) of the 2002 Act requires the court to decide on the recoverable amount, and to make a confiscation order in that sum.\n",
              "Section 7(1) provides that the recoverable amount is the defendants benefit from the conduct concerned.\n",
              "Section 7(2) states if the defendant shows that that benefit is more than the available amount, then the recoverable amount is the available amount.\n",
              "Section 9(1) explains that the available amount is the aggregate of all the free property available to the defendant at the time of the confiscation order, subject to any obligations which have priority (and property is free if it is not subject to certain forfeiture or deprivation orders sections 82 83).\n",
              "Section 76(4) of the 2002 Act provides that [a] person benefits from conduct if he obtains property as a result of or in connection with the conduct, and section 76(7) states that in such a case the persons benefit is the value of the property obtained.\n",
              "Section 79(1) provides that the value of any property held by a person at any time is to be determined in accordance with section 79(2), which states that that value is to be the market value at that time.\n",
              "Section 79(3) provides that if at that time another person holds an interest in the property its value, in relation to the person mentioned in subsection (1), is the market value of his interest at that time.\n",
              "Section 80(1) of the 2002 Act provides that the value of property obtained for the purpose of a confiscation order is its value at the time the court makes its decision, and section 80(2) provides that that value is to be the greater of (a) the value of the property (at the time the person obtained it), adjusted for inflation, and (b) the current value of the property.\n",
              "Section 80(4) states that the references to the value in section 80(2) are to the value found in accordance with section 79.\n",
              "Section 84(1) of the 2002 Act defines property in very wide terms, and it includes real or personal property, money, and intangible or incorporeal property.\n",
              "Section 84(2) contains some rules, which include in para (a) that, property is held by a person if he holds an interest in it, and in para (b) that property is obtained by a person if he obtains an interest in it.\n",
              "The only arguably relevant difference between the 1988 and 2002 Acts relates to the treatment of the definition of property.\n",
              "Whereas section 80(4) of the 2002 Act specifically applies to property when obtained as well as to property when held, section 74(4) of the 1988 Act only applies to property when held.\n",
              "However, particularly as property is held the moment it is obtained, it seems clear that, at least in relation to the issues raised on these appeals, the outcome is the same whichever statute applies.\n",
              "Accordingly, it is sensible simply to concentrate on the 2002 Act when discussing these appeals, but the observations which follow apply equally to the 1988 Act.\n",
              "Preliminary observations\n",
              "As Lord Bingham pointed out in May, para 8, a court considering an application for a confiscation order must address and answer three questions.\n",
              "The first question is whether a defendant has benefited from the relevant criminal conduct; the second question concerns the value, or quantification, of that benefit; and the third question is what sum is recoverable from the defendant.\n",
              "These are separate questions, and, although a degree of consistency of approach is required to all three questions and the answer to an earlier question will affect the answer to a subsequent question, the questions themselves should not be elided.\n",
              "When answering each question, the court must, of course, be guided by the 2002 Act.\n",
              "The 2002 Act has often been described as having been poorly drafted.\n",
              "That is a fair criticism, as can be illustrated by the problems which have had to be faced by the courts in a number of cases, some of which are referred to below.\n",
              "However, it is only fair to the drafters of the statute to record that the problems are partly explained by the difficulties inherent in the process of recovering the proceeds of crime from those convicted of offences.\n",
              "Those difficulties are at least threefold and are particularly acute when it comes to sophisticated crimes, such as large scale financial frauds, substantial illegal drug importing operations, and people trafficking, which involve many people, often in different countries.\n",
              "First, there are the practical impediments in the way of identifying, locating and recovering assets actually obtained through crime and then held by the criminals.\n",
              "The defendants will often, indeed normally, be as misleading and uninformative as they can, and the sophistications and occasional corruptions in the international financial community are such as to render the task of locating the proceeds of crime very hard, often impossible.\n",
              "Secondly, again owing to the reticence and dishonesty of the defendants, there will often be considerable, or even complete, uncertainty as to (i) the number, identity and role of the conspirators involved in the crime, and (ii) the quantum of the total proceeds of the crime, or how, when, and pursuant to what understanding or arrangement, the proceeds were, or were to be, distributed between the various conspirators.\n",
              "Thirdly, there will be obvious difficulties in applying established legal principles to the allocation of liability under the 2002 Act, as the rules relating to matters such as acquisition, joint and several ownership, and valuation of property and interests in property, and the rights and liabilities of owners, both as against the world and inter se, have been developed by the courts over centuries by reference to assets which were lawfully acquired and owned.\n",
              "The present appeals provide good examples of these problems.\n",
              "That is particularly true of the first appeal which, not least thanks to the full judgment of Flaux J, graphically illustrates all three difficulties, as may be appreciated from the summary in paras 11 17 above.\n",
              "When faced with an issue of interpretation of the 2002 Act, the court must, of course, arrive at a conclusion based both on the words of the statute and on legal principles, but it is also very important to bear in mind the overall aim of the statute, the need for practicality, and Convention rights.\n",
              "The overall aim of the statute is to recover assets acquired through criminal activity, both because it is wrong for criminals to retain the proceeds of crime and in order to show that crime does not pay.\n",
              "Practicality involves ensuring that, so far as is consistent with the wording of the statute and other legal principles, the recovery process, both in terms of any hearing and in terms of physically locating and confiscating the assets in question, is as simple, as predictable, and as effective, as possible.\n",
              "Defendants are entitled to their Convention rights, in particular to a fair trial under article 6 and are only to be deprived of assets in accordance with A1P1.\n",
              "It is also important to bear in mind that the issues raised on these appeals have\n",
              "been considered by the House of Lords, the Supreme Court, and the Court of Appeal on a number of occasions.\n",
              "In a trio of decisions, Lord Bingham, with whom the other Law Lords agreed, gave general guidance as to the application of the 1988 Act and confiscation provisions of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 see May, Jennings v Crown Prosecution Service [2008] UKHL 29; [2008] AC 1046 and R v Green [2008] UKHL 30; [2008] AC 1053.\n",
              "Also, in R v Waya [2012] UKHL 51; [2013] 1 AC 294, Lord Walker and Hughes LJ, speaking for the majority of the Supreme Court, considered aspects of the 2002 Act in some detail, and approved some decisions of the Court of Appeal concerned with valuation of obtained property, in particular R v Rose [2008] 1 WLR 2113; [2008] EWCA Crim 239; and R v Ascroft [2003] EWCA Crim 2365; [2004] 1 Cr App R (S) 326.\n",
              "R v Mackle [2014] UKSC 5; [2014] 2 WLR 267 was another decision of this Court concerned with the 2002 Act, and in the course of his judgment, Lord Kerr, with whom the other Justices agreed, approved the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal in cases which had provided further guidance to judges hearing confiscation claims, including R v Sivaraman [2008] EWCA Crim 1736; [2009] 1 Cr App R (S) 464 and R v Allpress [2009] EWCA Crim 8; [2009] 2 Cr App R (S) 399.\n",
              "It would be wrong to depart from the guidance given in these cases unless it was shown that they were plainly wrong or unless it was established that they had led to problems for courts making confiscation orders.\n",
              "Adherence to previous guidance from this court is mandated by the need to ensure that the law is clear and predictable as well as by the doctrine of precedent.\n",
              "These factors are particularly appropriate in the present circumstances, because, as mentioned, the 2002 Act and its statutory predecessors have given rise to considerable difficulties in terms of both hearings and subsequent enforcement.\n",
              "It has not been suggested that those difficulties have been caused or aggravated by the guidance given in the cases referred to in the preceding paragraph, and there is therefore a real risk that any departure from that guidance would serve to confuse an already inherently difficult procedure.\n",
              "The first question: has the defendant benefited?\n",
              "Section 76(4) of the 2002 Act provides that a person benefits from conduct if he obtains property as a result of or in connection with the conduct.\n",
              "In Jennings, para 12, Lord Bingham agreed with Laws LJ in the Court of Appeal that the essence of benefit in that phrase is given by the word obtains.\n",
              "Thus, one is concerned with what the particular defendant obtained, which is by no means necessarily the same as the totality of what was obtained by the criminal enterprise of which he was a party.\n",
              "Lord Bingham explained that obtain in this context must ordinarily mean that a defendant has obtained property so as to own it, whether alone or jointly, which will ordinarily connote a power of disposition or control, as where a person directs a payment or conveyance of property to someone else see Jennings, para 13 and May, para 48(6).\n",
              "At least in a technical, legal, sense, there are two problems with this analysis.\n",
              "The first involves a generally applicable point; the second applies in cases such as the present ones, where the facts are complex and there are several conspirators involved.\n",
              "Whilst a criminal may sometimes become the owner of property obtained through crime, in many cases he does not do so.\n",
              "When a person obtains a chattel, money, a credit balance or land through criminal dishonesty, he does not acquire title to, or ownership of, the item in question, although he does acquire control over it.\n",
              "As was pointed out by Lord Walker and Hughes LJ in Waya, para 68 a person who dishonestly obtains property has at most a possessory interest good against third parties, and thus of no significant value.\n",
              "When Lord Bingham spoke of obtaining something so as to own it he was doing so in the context of contrasting the position of someone who unlawfully assumes the rights of an owner (ie a power of disposition or control) with the position of a mere courier or custodian of stolen property see May at para 48(6).\n",
              "In Allpress at para 64 the Court of Appeal helpfully interpolated the words assumes the rights of an owner to make this clear.\n",
              "Unless a joint obtaining is understood in this sense, then the concept of joint ownership is difficult to marry up with the facts of most cases of financial fraud or drug importation, involving many conspirators.\n",
              "Lawful joint owners enjoy unity of possession, which means that each co owner is entitled to possession of the whole of the asset, unity of interest, which means that each co owner is entitled to an equal interest as against the other co owners, and unity of time, which means that each co owner acquired his interest at the same time.\n",
              "Joint ownership is a legal fiction.\n",
              "Bracton fo 430 (ed Woodbine, vol 4, 336) states that each joint owner totum tenet et nihil tenet (holds everything and holds nothing).\n",
              "More recently, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead referred to the notion of each joint owner owning the whole asset as an esoteric concept remote from the realities of modern life Burton v Camden London Borough Council [2000] 2 AC 399, 404.\n",
              "In addition to joint ownership, the law also recognises ownership in common.\n",
              "Owners in common also enjoy unity of possession, but do not need to have unity of interest or of time, so they can have different interests, as between each other.\n",
              "Such considerations are inapposite in relation to criminals with no rights of ownership in the property obtained.\n",
              "Insofar as technical English property law concepts are concerned, it may be more accurate to refer to several conspirators acquiring possession in common of any asset or money, rather than jointly owning the asset or money.\n",
              "However, rather than invoking English property law concepts, it is more appropriate to treat such conspirators as obtaining the asset or money together, which has the same meaning as jointly, provided that the latter word is understood in its ordinary English, and not its technical, legal sense.\n",
              "Obtain is the statutory word, and joint reflects the criminal enterprise.\n",
              "While some aspects of English property law in connection with ownership may be esoteric, there is nothing remote from daily life about two burglars jointly (ie together) obtaining a television.\n",
              "The burglars do not become the owners of the television, and the argument about them being joint owners or owners in common proceeds on a wrong premise.\n",
              "Each burglar has usurped the rights of the owner.\n",
              "The basic point made by Lord Bingham, and discussed in paras 41 42 above, therefore appears to us to be, to put it at its lowest, sustainable, given the statutory language, which is not concerned with ownership but with obtaining.\n",
              "As just demonstrated, it is perfectly acceptable, as a matter of ordinary language, to describe the people involved in a criminal joint enterprise which results in the obtaining of a chattel, cash, a credit balance or land, as having jointly obtained the item concerned, in the sense of having obtained it between them.\n",
              "The fact that the item may have been physically taken or acquired by, or held in the name of, one of them does not undermine the conclusion that they jointly obtained it.\n",
              "The word obtain should be given a broad, normal meaning, and the non statutory word joint, referred to by Lord Bingham in May, paras 17 and 27 34, should be understood in the same non technical way.\n",
              "Accordingly, where property is obtained as a result of a joint criminal enterprise, it will often be appropriate for a court to hold that each of the conspirators obtained the whole of that property.\n",
              "That is the view expressed in May, para 48(6), first sentence (although the word owns is probably inappropriate), in Green, para 15, and in Allpress, para 31 (as quoted and approved in Mackle, para 65).\n",
              "However, that will by no means be the correct conclusion in every such case.\n",
              "As was said in Sivaraman, para 12 (6) and in Allpress, paras 30 31 (and approved in Mackle, paras 64 65), when a defendant has been convicted of an offence which involved several conspirators, and resulted in the obtaining of property, the court has to decide on the basis of the evidence, often relying on common sense inferences, whether the defendant in question obtained the property in the sense of assuming the rights of an owner over it, either because he received it or because he was to have some sort of share in it or its proceeds, and, in that connection, the role of a particular conspirator may be relevant as a matter of fact, but that is a purely evidential matter.\n",
              "In some cases, one or more of the conspirators may be able to show that he\n",
              "was only involved to a limited extent, so that he did not in any way obtain the property which was obtained as a result of the crime.\n",
              "Examples include acting as a paid hand in the enterprise eg an intermediary, a courier or a drugs mule (as considered in May, paras 15 and 17, and in Allpress, paras 80 82) or a latecomer to a conspiracy in which nothing was obtained after his arrival (as discussed in May, para 19).\n",
              "It is clear from May at paragraph 34 that the amount of the benefit which a defendant obtains is not affected by the amount which might be obtained by others to whom he transfers any part of it (any more than it can be affected by his payment out of the expenses of his criminal venture).\n",
              "However, there could be other cases where the court may be satisfied on the evidence that individual defendants obtained (ie assumed the rights of an owner over) only a specific part or share of the property which had been acquired as a result of the criminal activity.\n",
              "An example might be several obtainings by different criminals using a common form of deception which they have agreed to use, but several obtainings are not limited to such a case.\n",
              "Lord Bingham recognised in May at para 32 that there could be such cases, albeit that R v Gibbons [2002] EWCA Crim 3161; [2003] 2 Cr App R (S) 169 (there referred to) was in fact a case in which the Court of Appeal did no more than uphold an order for 18,000, much less than an equal share of the whole, on the basis that the defendant could not have obtained less.\n",
              "There has sometimes been a tendency to equiparate joint involvement in the crime with joint ownership of the fruits of the crime.\n",
              "But the fact that the defendants were jointly responsible for the crime in question does not automatically justify a conclusion that they jointly obtained the resulting property, a point well made by the Court of Appeal in Allpress, para 31.\n",
              "The tendency to conclude that property is jointly obtained by criminals may also be attributable to the fact that it is often difficult to determine how the asset(s) obtained has, or have, been distributed between the defendants.\n",
              "Judges in confiscation proceedings should be ready to investigate and make findings as to whether there were separate obtainings.\n",
              "Sometimes of course this is too difficult or impossible.\n",
              "In many cases the court will not have before it all the conspirators for a variety of reasons.\n",
              "The indictment may well name other conspirators (as well as including the usual phrase and other persons unknown).\n",
              "A court should never make a finding that there has been joint obtaining from convenience, or worse from laziness.\n",
              "Where the evidence supports a finding that the asset acquired from a crime was obtained effectively on a several basis, the judge should make it, but there are cases in which a finding of joint obtaining is the proper, indeed the only available finding, especially but not only where an inference or presumption that the defendants before the court were the only joint obtainers would be contrary to the probabilities.\n",
              "In the two cases before the Court, all that is known with any degree of confidence is that there was a fraud, the defendants played a major part in it, and the fraud resulted in a sum of money being obtained.\n",
              "Certainly in the first appeal, there were others closely involved in the crime, but it is not clear how many or who they were.\n",
              "There is no reliable evidence as to whether any particular person involved in the fraud received any particular portion of, or had any particular interest in or share of, the money obtained by the fraud.\n",
              "In these circumstances, it was fully open to Flaux J to decide that the proceeds of the criminal activity, the property, had been obtained by the conspirators, or at least all the principal conspirators, who included the defendants before him.\n",
              "Indeed, on the basis of the primary facts as we understand them, in each case, it is hard to see how he could have come to any other conclusion.\n",
              "Although the argument of Mr Owen QC does not overtly challenge the finding that the Fields defendants jointly obtained property to the value of 1.4m, it comes close to doing so and thus it applies to the first question, as well as to the second question, which is the question to which it principally applies.\n",
              "The argument is best examined by reference to the Ahmad defendants, in the light of the fact that Flaux J gave a much fuller judgment in the confiscation proceedings involving the Ahmad defendants than was given in the proceedings involving the Fields defendants.\n",
              "The argument can be analysed as amounting to a contention that Flaux J should have apportioned the 12.6m equally between the two Ahmad defendants, to justify the conclusion that the property each of them obtained under the 2002 Act was half the total sum acquired.\n",
              "The argument has its attractions.\n",
              "It can be said to accord with the presumption that, where two people lawfully own property jointly the beneficial interest belongs to the[m] in equal shares per Lord Diplock in Gissing v Gissing [1971] AC 886, 908.\n",
              "It also would avoid the risk of double recovery or unfair recovery.\n",
              "However, we would reject the argument.\n",
              "First, to accept that argument would involve a reversal of the law as laid down by the House of Lords six years ago, and affirmed by this Court recently.\n",
              "In Green the question certified by the Court of Appeal was: Where any payment or other reward in connection with drug trafficking is received jointly by two or more persons acting as principals to a drug trafficking offence does the value of each persons proceeds of drug traffickinginclude the whole of the value of such payment or reward ? The House of Lords held that the correct answer was yes.\n",
              "In his judgment Lord Bingham expressly approved at para 15 a passage in the judgment of Court of Appeal in which David Clarke J said: we consider that where money or property is received by one defendant on behalf of several defendants jointly, each defendant is to be regarded as having received the whole of it for the purposes of section 2(2) of the Act [Drug Trafficking Act 1994].\n",
              "It does not matter that proceeds of sale may have been received by one conspirator who retains his share before passing on the remainder; what matters is the capacity in which he received them.\n",
              "The provisions of the statute there in question were similar to section 79(2) and (3) of the 2002 Act.\n",
              "Mr Owens argument in this case is essentially a re run of his argument in that case, which the House rejected.\n",
              "Secondly, as we have sought to explain, cases under the 2002 Act involve obtaining not ownership, and, even if they did, we are doubtful whether the ownership would be technically joint.\n",
              "Thirdly, Mr Owens approach would render the prospect of full recovery even more unlikely than it already is.\n",
              "That is because, in many multi party sophisticated crimes, it is unusual to have all the conspirators before the court, the defendants who are before the court will say that the other conspirators received all the property, and frequently many of those other conspirators will never be apprehended.\n",
              "Fourthly, for similar reasons, it would render the task of a judge at a confiscation hearing more difficult than it already is, and would make it correspondingly easier for an unscrupulous defendant (and most defendants in these cases appear, unsurprisingly, to be unscrupulous) to seek to avoid, or at least to minimise, his liability.\n",
              "In many cases it is often completely unclear how many people were involved in the crime, what their roles were, and where the money went.\n",
              "As a result, if the court could not proceed on the basis that the conspirators should be treated as having acquired the proceeds of the crime together, so that each of them obtained the property, it would often be impossible to decide what part of the proceeds had been obtained by any or all of the defendants.\n",
              "There is obvious cause for concern about having to inquire into the financial dealings between criminals who have together obtained property, especially given that the ringleaders are often not even before the court.\n",
              "It is one thing for the court to have to decide whether a defendant obtained any property, which the 2002 Act requires.\n",
              "It is another thing for the court to have to adjudicate on the respective shares of benefit jointly obtained, which the Act does not appear to require.\n",
              "The first appeal provides a good example of the problems which a court would face if Mr Owens approach was adopted.\n",
              "It is possible that the whole profit of 12.6m had passed through the hands of the two Ahmad defendants.\n",
              "That is unlikely, for it was paid out by HMRC to the exporting company, which could be expected to retain at least something.\n",
              "However, even if the whole of the 12.6m did pass through the Ahmad defendants hands, it is much more likely than not that some of it was distributed to the others who were involved, who may have been either few or numerous.\n",
              "The assumption that the two Ahmad defendants retained the whole of the gains between them is therefore rebutted on the balance of probabilities.\n",
              "But there is no material on which to judge how much was either retained by others en route to them, or distributed to others by them.\n",
              "Nor is there any material on which to judge whether some or all of the others were fee paid assistants (as in Allpress), or full accomplices sharing in the profits, and if the latter, in what proportions.\n",
              "An assumption that accomplices shared the profits equally is of no help if one cannot know how many of them there were.\n",
              "Thus, unless the judge could treat each of the Ahmad defendants as having obtained the whole of the 12.6m, he would either have had to make findings which have no proper basis in evidence, or he would have been unable to attribute the obtaining of any specific sum to either defendant.\n",
              "Fifthly, as for the risk of double recovery, it can be avoided for the reasons given in this judgment, when considering the third question.\n",
              "Sixthly, and more specifically to the first appeal, it would be logically incoherent to hold the two Ahmad defendants each liable for half of the property simply on the basis that it would be oppressive for each to be liable for the whole.\n",
              "If an argument based on oppression were right, then no order could be made unless the number of participants and the role of every participant in the fraud could be ascertained.\n",
              "Finally, it may be that, if the Ahmad defendants had been frank rather than dishonest in their evidence, they could have shown that the facts justified a conclusion that the property which MST obtained was limited to the share of the 12.6m which it actually received, and/or that their individual liabilities should each be held to be for a sum equal to half the property obtained by MST. (It is only right to add that it may well be that, even if they had been honest with the court, the facts would not have justified such a conclusion.) As it was, given the complete absence of any assistance from the Ahmad defendants (indeed, what they said was positively misleading), the judge had no alternative to falling back on the natural conclusion that, through the vehicle of MST, they had been major participants in the carousel fraud, and had therefore obtained the whole 12.6m, albeit together with the other participants (only some of whom could be identified).\n",
              "The second question: what is the value of the benefit?\n",
              "In a case such as the present ones, where the court has concluded that a defendant has obtained property together with others, the question which arises is how to value the property which he has obtained.\n",
              "It is clear from section 79(1) and (2) that it has to be the market value.\n",
              "The argument for apportioned valuation is that, although section 84(2)(b) contains an injunction to assume that each defendant has obtained the whole property, section 79(3) requires the valuation of the property to take into account the interests of accomplices.\n",
              "This is essentially the same argument, which we have rejected above when addressing the question of what has been obtained.\n",
              "The argument misunderstands the purpose and effect of section 79(3).\n",
              "A defendant who steals property or obtains it by deception does not, as explained above, acquire ownership of that property.\n",
              "In answering the second question, in such a case (ie putting a figure on the benefit which the thief has obtained) the court takes the market value of the goods, but not because this represents the value of the thiefs legal interest in the goods, which would be nil.\n",
              "As explained in Rose, approved in Waya, the court takes the market value of the property because that is the value of what the thief has misappropriated, viz what it would cost anyone to acquire it on the open market. (If the 2002 Act required the court to value the thiefs interest in the misappropriated property, section 79(3) would require it to take into account any other persons interest, which would include the owner, but that was precisely the argument which the court rejected because it would make a nonsense of the statute.) Likewise if two defendants jointly misappropriate property, neither of them obtains a legal interest in it and neither has an interest for the purpose of section 79(3).\n",
              "In relation to each of them, the value is the value of what they have taken, viz the market value of the misappropriated property.\n",
              "Thus, once a defendant has obtained the property, whether solely or jointly, that market value is the value of what he has obtained.\n",
              "The current effect of the authorities is that the interests of accomplices are not to be taken into account for the purposes of section 79(3) ie that they are not to be treated as interest[s] for this purpose.\n",
              "That is clear from Lord Binghams judgment in May, and in particular his critique of earlier cases in paras 27 29 and 31, his conclusion in para 46, and his concluding remark in para 48(6), as well as from the actual decision in Green especially paras 15 and 16.\n",
              "It is also part of the reasoning of this Court in Waya, (unanimous on this point) where Lord Walker and Hughes LJ, having discussed section 84(2)(b), went on to say, at para 68, that the effect of section 79(3) is that lawfully co existing interests in property are to be valued individually.\n",
              "In the light of that observation, it seems clear that the interests of a defendants co conspirators are not to be taken into account when valuing the property for the purpose of assessing the value of the property which the defendant obtained.\n",
              "Furthermore, as explained in paras 47 50 above, when one is valuing the property which a conspirator, including a defendant, has obtained, one is not normally valuing an interest at all.\n",
              "Even more recently, the Supreme Court effectively confirmed the correctness of this approach when, in Mackle, paras 64 65, Lord Kerr approved the Court of Appeals decision in Allpress to follow its earlier decision in Sivaraman, where the decision and reasoning of the House of Lords in Green had been correctly analysed and applied.\n",
              "This approach is soundly based in principle.\n",
              "At the first question stage (what has been obtained) it may be necessary to examine the dealings of the criminals inter se, to the extent of determining whether a particular defendant has obtained anything at all (Allpress) or to decide whether any obtainings were joint or several.\n",
              "However, once it has been determined that a particular defendant obtained property, whether alone or jointly, the answer to the second question is that the value of that property is its market value.\n",
              "The court should not be called upon to investigate unlawful claims (which do not amount to rights) as between accomplices.\n",
              "Accordingly, it seems to us that, at least on the basis of the approach adopted by the House of Lords in May and Green and by this Court in Waya, there is force in the view that recognis[ing] a trust in these criminal circumstances would tend to run entirely counter to the statutory aim, as Davis LJ put it in his judgment in the Fields case [2013] EWCA Crim 2042, [2014] 2 WLR 233, para 36, reflecting comments from other judges in earlier cases.\n",
              "This point is reinforced by the view expressed in Waya, para 21, where Lord Walker and Hughes LJ described the confiscation system as a severe regime which was intended to have a deterrent effect on at least some would be criminals, although they added that the legislations deterrent qualities are, no doubt, an incident of it, but they are not its essence.\n",
              "Although, in paras 53 59 above, we have considered Mr Owens argument in relation to the first question, it truly belongs in the second question.\n",
              "Having determined that each of the Ahmad defendants obtained the whole of the 12.6m, the argument is that the valuation exercise requires each of the appellants to be treated as having acquired an interest equal in value to half the 12.6m.\n",
              "As in relation to the first question, that argument has the attraction of being consistent with the ordinary cases of beneficial joint ownership, but it would have to be very persuasive before we were justified in departing from this clear and consistent approach in relation to the second question.\n",
              "Essentially for the reasons given above, we would reject Mr Owens argument in relation to the second question.\n",
              "The inappropriateness of adopting an approach which a court would consider appropriate for the rights and obligations of joint creditors and debtors is reinforced when one considers the so called Highwaymans Case of 1725, Everet v Williams, noted at (1893) 9 LQR 106.\n",
              "That case shows that the courts powers cannot be invoked in connection with a criminal exercise in that case to accord discovery, an account and other relief in connection with a partnership between two highwaymen.\n",
              "The position of joint obtainers under the 2002 Act inter se is very different from that of two lawful joint owners or joint debtors, and it is unsurprising if their rights and obligations under the 2002 Act do not follow those of such owners and debtors.\n",
              "Mr Owen pointed out that the valuation provisions of the 2002 Act apply both to the assessment of the value of the benefit obtained (the second question) and the assessment of the available amount (the third question), and suggested that it could not be right that the same sum in respect of the same property should be included in the amount assessed as available to each of two (or more) defendants because the same amount could not be realised from each of them.\n",
              "Accordingly, he said, the same sum could not be attributed to the value of benefit obtained by two defendants in relation the second question.\n",
              "We do not accept that the same amount may not be available to each of them at the time when the court is deciding the third question.\n",
              "If money is held in a joint bank account on which each defendant has a mandate to draw, it is at that stage available to each of them.\n",
              "A new situation will arise if and when one of them draws the money to meet the confiscation order, but that raises a different point.\n",
              "For those reasons, on the second question, we would reject the argument of Mr Owen and would adhere to the principles established in May, Green, Waya and Mackle, and the decisions of the Court of Appeal which they approved.\n",
              "In the first appeal, it therefore follows that the Court of Appeal was right to conclude that each of the Ahmad defendants obtained 16.1m (after adjusting for inflation) as property, and that that was the value of their benefit.\n",
              "In the second appeal, as Davis LJ noted, there was no appeal against the judges finding that the Fields defendants jointly obtained a benefit worth 1.6m (after adjusting for inflation), and in those circumstances, it follows from the above discussion, that he was right to hold that the benefit to be valued in respect of each defendant was the whole amount of the property obtained.\n",
              "Reflecting what is said in paras 50 51 above, it may be that this was a case where the court concluded too readily that there has been a joint obtaining where the better view may have been that the defendants have obtained different property.\n",
              "However, that question does not arise on these appeals.\n",
              "The third question: what is the sum payable?\n",
              "Mr Mitchell, on behalf of the Ahmad defendants, did not challenge the propriety of the finding that they had each benefited in the amount of the property jointly obtained by them, but he submitted, in reliance on A1P1, that any payment of an amount under the confiscation order by one of them should reduce or extinguish the amount payable by the other, and that the order should contain a proviso to that effect.\n",
              "The argument in support of his submission is simple.\n",
              "It is true, as has been said many times, that the legislation is directed towards the proceeds and not the profits of crime, but it would not serve the legitimate aim of the legislation and would be disproportionate for the state to take the same proceeds twice over.\n",
              "This Court has considered the provisions of A1P1 in the context of the 2002 Act in two recent cases: Waya and in Barnes v Eastenders Cash & Carry plc [2014] UKSC 26, [2014] 2 WLR 1269.\n",
              "In Waya, paras 11 13, Lord Walker and Hughes LJ summarised the requirements of A1P1 and section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998.\n",
              "In Barnes, paras 53ff, Lord Toulson reviewed the Strasbourg jurisprudence.\n",
              "It is unnecessary to repeat the summary or the analysis in this case; the general principles are well understood.\n",
              "In our view Mr Mitchells argument is as compelling as it is simple.\n",
              "To take the same proceeds twice over would not serve the legitimate aim of the legislation and, even if that were not so, it would be disproportionate.\n",
              "The violation of A1P1 would occur at the time when the state sought to enforce an order for the confiscation of proceeds of crime which have already been paid to the state.\n",
              "The appropriate way of avoiding such a violation would be, as Mr Mitchell has submitted, for the confiscation order made against each defendant to be subject to a condition which would prevent that occurrence.\n",
              "This approach may appear to risk producing inequity between criminal conspirators, on the basis that some of them may well obtain a windfall because the amount of the confiscation order will be paid by another.\n",
              "However, that is an inherent feature of joint criminality.\n",
              "If the victim of a fraud were to sue the conspirators and to obtain judgments against them, he would be entitled to enforce against whichever defendant he most easily could.\n",
              "The losses must lie where they fall, and there is nothing surprising, let alone wrong, in the criminal courts adopting that approach.\n",
              "Accordingly, where a finding of joint obtaining is made, whether against a single defendant or more than one, the confiscation order should be made for the whole value of the benefit thus obtained, but should provide that it is not to be enforced to the extent that a sum has been recovered by way of satisfaction of another confiscation order made in relation to the same joint benefit.\n",
              "A subsequent confiscation order made against a later tried defendant in relation to the same benefit may well be such an order.\n",
              "In theory a court might therefore need to consider whether to stay the enforcement of a confiscation order made against one or more defendants to await the outcome of a later criminal trial against other defendants in respect of the same criminal conspiracy.\n",
              "However, except perhaps when a second trial is imminent this would not normally be appropriate bearing in mind the purpose of the 2002 Act and the statutory stipulation for a speedy hearing (see para 10 above).\n",
              "Orders made on the basis of lifestyle assumptions will require special consideration on their facts.\n",
              "This conclusion is in line with the outcome in the case of R v Gangar [2012] EWCA Crim 1378; [2013] 1 WLR 147, although it is based on slightly different reasoning.\n",
              "In that case, the Court of Appeal held that, when assessing the available amount the court must recognise that the same asset cannot be sold and converted to cash twice.\n",
              "Once the solution now propounded is adopted, the confiscation order will be for the full amount obtained by the conspirators against each defendant, but its enforcement more than once will be prevented.\n",
              "Unlike the arguments raised by Mr Owen on behalf of the Fields defendants, this argument raised by Mr Mitchell on behalf of the Ahmad defendants does not involve calling into question any decision made or guidance given by the House of Lords or the Supreme Court.\n",
              "It simply involves qualifying the effect of the orders which would follow from those decisions in a way which, while not contemplated in any of the judgments, is not inconsistent with anything said in them, and on a basis which was not considered, let alone rejected, in them.\n",
              "We should mention that, before this judgment was handed down, our attention was drawn to the recent judgment of the Strasbourg court in Paulet v United Kingdom (Application No 6219/08) (unreported) 13 May 2014, where a violation of A1P1 was found in relation to a confiscation order.\n",
              "Nothing in that judgment causes us to reconsider our conclusion in these cases.\n",
              "Conclusion\n",
              "In these circumstances, we would allow the appeals by both the Ahmad defendants and by the Fields defendants, but only to the extent of directing that the confiscation order in respect of each defendant be amended along the lines indicated in the first sentence of para 74 above.</td>\n",

              "In the first appeal, the appellants, Shakeel Ahmad and Syed Ahmed (the Ahmad defendants) were convicted of a carousel fraud (which involves criminally misusing the collection system of VAT to extract money from the revenue authorities) and sentenced to seven years in prison.\n",
              "The Ahmad defendants had been the sole directors and shareholders of a company, MST, which was registered for VAT.\n",
              "MST participated in 32 circular transactions by which goods were purportedly sold, and later bought back by, companies in Ireland in circumstances which resulted in 12.6 million being fraudulently reclaimed from HMRC.\n",
              "After a confiscation hearing, Flaux J concluded that, for the purposes of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (the 1988 Act), the benefit obtained by MST was the benefit obtained by the Ahmad defendants jointly. (While the 1988 Act has been repealed and replaced by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (the 2002 Act), the 1988 Act still applies to crimes committed before the 2002 Act came into force).\n",
              "The Court of Appeal determined that the benefit jointly obtained by the Ahmad defendants was the loss suffered by HMRC, uplifted to 16.1m to adjust for inflation, and that each of the Ahmad defendants was liable for the whole of this amount.\n",
              "In the second appeal, the three appellants, Michael Fields, Mitesh Sanghani and Karamjit Sagoo (the Fields defendants), and a fourth man, Wasim Rajput, were found guilty by a jury of conspiracy to defraud.\n",
              "The Fields defendants were each sentenced to five years in prison.\n",
              "The fraudulent conspiracy involved the use of a company, MDL, whose published accounts falsely recorded that it had over 1m in fixed assets in order to secure credit agreements to buy goods or obtain services.\n",
              "MDL made no payments under these agreements, and the majority of the goods disappeared.\n",
              "In the subsequent confiscation proceedings HH Judge Carr found that the total benefit arising from the conspiracy was about 1.4m, which had been acquired jointly by the Fields defendants.\n",
              "This figure was adjusted upwards to about 1.6m to allow for inflation and the judge made confiscation orders under the 2002 Act against each of the Fields defendants for the whole of this amount.\n",
              "The subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeal was unsuccessful.\n",
              "The Ahmad defendants and the Fields defendants now appeal to this court.\n",
              "They do not challenge the quantification of the aggregate recoverable amount, or the finding that they obtained that amount jointly.\n",
              "What they challenge is the decision of the Court of Appeal that each of the appellants should be separately liable for the whole of that amount.\n",
              "The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal in part.\n",
              "Lord Neuberger, Lord Hughes and Lord Toulson, with whom Lord Sumption and Lord Reed agree, give the judgment.\n",
              "The confiscation orders made in respect of each defendant should be amended to provide that they can be enforced only to the extent that the same sum has not been recovered through another confiscation order made in relation to the same joint benefit.\n",
              "However, the orders should not be amended to apportion the benefit between the respective defendants.\n",
              "Although the language of the 1988 and 2002 Acts is not identical, there is no material difference between them for present purposes [28].\n",
              "A court considering an application for a confiscation order must address and answer three questions.\n",
              "The first question is whether a defendant has benefited from the relevant criminal conduct; the second question concerns the value, or quantification of the benefit; and the third question is what sum is recoverable from the defendant [34].\n",
              "The first question: has the defendant benefited? Section 76(4) of the 2002 Act provides that a person benefits from conduct if he obtains property as a result or in connection with the conduct.\n",
              "As Lord Bingham held in Jennings v Crown Prosecution Service [2008] AC 1046 and R v May [2008] AC 1028, the essence of benefit in that phrase is given by the word obtains, which in this context should be given a broad, normal meaning connoting a power of disposition or control rather than ownership [41 45].\n",
              "In many cases it is unclear how many people were involved in the crime, what their roles were, and where the money went.\n",
              "As a result, if the court could not proceed on the basis that the conspirators should be treated as having acquired the proceeds of the crime together, so that each of them obtained the property, it would often be impossible to decide what part of the proceeds had been obtained by any or all of the defendants.\n",
              "It is one thing for the court to have to decide whether a defendant obtained any property, which is required by the 2002 Act.\n",
              "It is another for the court to have to adjudicate on the respective shares of benefit jointly obtained, which is not required [56].\n",
              "Where property is obtained as a result of a joint criminal exercise, it will often be appropriate for a court to hold that each of the conspirators obtained the whole of that property.\n",
              "However, where the evidence discloses separate obtainings, the judge should make that finding [46 51].\n",
              "The second question: what is the value of the benefit? A defendant who steals property or obtains it by deception does not acquire ownership of that property.\n",
              "When valuing the benefit the court takes the market value of the property obtained, not because this represents the value of the thiefs legal interest in the goods, but because that is the value of what the thief has misappropriated [61].\n",
              "The third question: what is the sum payable? To take the same proceeds twice over would not serve the legitimate aim of the 2002 Act and, even if that were not so, it would be disproportionate.\n",
              "The enforcement of an order for the confiscation of proceeds of crime that have already been paid to the state would violate Article 1 of the First Protocol the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to property [71].</td>\n",

              "She contended that throughout the time that her son was in Iraq the United Kingdom owed him a duty to respect his right to life under article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights and that the inquest also had to satisfy the procedural requirements of article 2.\n",
              "On more narrow grounds than these the Secretary of State conceded that Mrs Smith was entitled to the relief that she sought, and a new inquest is to be held.\n",
              "Two issues of public importance have been raised by her claim.\n",
              "Is a soldier on military service abroad in Iraq subject to the protection of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the HRA) when outside his base? I shall call this the jurisdiction issue.\n",
              "If so, must the death of such a soldier be the subject of an inquest that satisfies the procedures that article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention) implicitly requires where there is reason to believe that a death may be attributable to default on the part of a public authority? I shall call this the inquest issue.\n",
              "These issues are largely academic inasmuch as the Secretary of State has conceded that a fresh inquest must be held in relation to Private Smiths death that satisfies those Convention requirements a concession which does not, of course, bind the Coroner.\n",
              "The courts below have nonetheless been prepared to entertain them because of their importance and this court has done the same.\n",
              "The jurisdiction issue\n",
              "Mrs Smith succeeded on this issue, both at first instance and before the Court of Appeal.\n",
              "Section 6(1) of the HRA provides: It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.\n",
              "Section 1 defines the Convention rights as including articles 2 to 12 and 14 of the Convention.\n",
              "It is common ground that the HRA is capable of applying outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, but that section 6(1) will only be infringed by conduct that the Strasbourg Court would hold to have violated a Convention right.\n",
              "This was determined by the House of Lords in R (Al Skeini) v Secretary of State for Defence [2008] AC 153.\n",
              "It follows that, in order to decide whether conduct has infringed section 6(1) of the HRA it is necessary to consider the ambit of application of the Convention.\n",
              "More particularly, no claim can succeed under the HRA unless there has been a breach of a Convention right of a person within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom that should have been secured pursuant to article 1.\n",
              "Article 1 of the Convention provides: The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section 1 of this Convention.\n",
              "The jurisdiction issue is whether, on the true interpretation of article 1, British troops operating on foreign soil fall within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.\n",

              "The Grand Chamber sat to consider this question in Bankovic v United Kingdom (2001) 11 BHRC 435, which has been recognised both in this country and at Strasbourg as a leading case on the scope of jurisdiction under article 1.\n",
              "I propose to start by considering that case.\n",
              "Bankovic\n",
              "Five of the applicants in Bankovic were close relatives of civilians killed by air strikes carried out on a radio and television centre in Belgrade by members of NATO, when intervening in the Kosovo conflict in 1999.\n",
              "The sixth applicant had himself been injured in the raids.\n",
              "The critical issue in relation to admissibility was whether the applicants and their deceased relatives came within the jurisdiction of the respondent States within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "The applicants founded their case on the reasoning of the Court in Loizidou v Turkey (1995) 20 EHRR 99.\n",
              "The Court held in that case that a Greek Cypriot, who claimed in relation to the dispossession of her property in Northern Cyprus, was potentially within the jurisdiction of Turkey for the purposes of article 1 by reason of the fact that Turkey exercised effective control of Northern Cyprus.\n",
              "The applicants in Bankovic accepted that they could not contend that the action of the member States in bombing Belgrade put them under an obligation in relation to the observance of all of the Convention rights in the area bombed, but argued that they should be held accountable for those rights that did fall within their control, and in particular the right to life of those whom they bombed.\n",
              "The Court applied the principles agreed in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 (the Vienna Convention) to the task of interpreting article 1.\n",
              "Thus it paid primary regard to the natural meaning of the words used, but also took into consideration the travaux prparatoires (the travaux) and State practice.\n",
              "This approach contrasted with the approach that the Strasbourg Court has adopted of treating the Convention as a living instrument when considering the manner in which it operates.\n",
              "The Court recognised this at paras 64 and 65 but commented that the scope of article 1 was determinative of the scope and reach of the entire Convention system of human rights protection.\n",
              "The Court was indicating that the meaning of article 1, and thus the scope of application of the Convention, could not change over time, and this seems plainly correct as a matter of principle.\n",
              "I shall describe this as the original meaning principle.\n",
              "The Court approached the natural meaning of jurisdiction on the premise that this had to be consonant with the meaning of that word under principles of public international law.\n",
              "Under these principles the jurisdictional competence of a State was primarily territorial.\n",
              "Thus: article 1 of the Convention must be considered to reflect this ordinary and essentially territorial notion of jurisdiction, other bases of jurisdiction being exceptional and requiring special justification in the particular circumstances of each caseIn keeping with the essentially territorial notion of jurisdiction, the court has accepted only in exceptional cases that acts of the contracting states performed, or producing effects, outside their territories can constitute an exercise of jurisdiction by them within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention. (paras 61 and 67)\n",
              "Thus the Court held that jurisdiction in article 1 was not limited to the territory over which a State exercises lawful authority.\n",
              "It extended in exceptional circumstances requiring special justification to other bases of jurisdiction.\n",
              "The difficulty in delineating article 1 jurisdiction arises in identifying and defining the exceptions to territorial jurisdiction.\n",
              "The Court recognised that one such exception arose where a member State had taken effective control of part of the territory of another member State.\n",
              "I shall call this the principle of effective territorial control.\n",
              "Loizidou v Turkey exemplified this jurisdiction.\n",
              "The Court justified this exception by remarking at para 80 that the inhabitants of Northern Cyprus would have found themselves excluded from the benefits of the Convention safeguards and system which they had previously enjoyed by Turkeys effective control of the territory and by the accompanying inability of the Cypriot Government, as a contracting State, to fulfil the obligations that it had undertaken under the Convention.\n",
              "Thus the Court appeared to restrict the principle of effective territorial control to the territories of the contracting States.\n",
              "The Court made the following comments about this head of jurisdiction: 71.\n",
              "In sum, the case law of the Court demonstrates that its recognition of the exercise of extra territorial jurisdiction by a contracting state is exceptional: it has done so when the respondent state, through the effective control of the relevant territory and its inhabitants abroad as a consequence of military occupation or through the consent, invitation or acquiescence of the government of that territory, exercises all or some of the public powers normally to be exercised by that government. 80.\n",
              "In short, the Convention is a multi lateral treaty operating, subject to article 56 of the Convention, in an essentially regional context and notably in the legal space (espace juridique) of the contracting states.\n",
              "The FRY clearly does not fall within this legal space.\n",
              "The Convention was not designed to be applied throughout the world, even in respect of the conduct of contracting states.\n",
              "Accordingly, the desirability of avoiding a gap or vacuum in human rights protection has so far been relied on by the Court in favour of establishing jurisdiction only when the territory in question was one that, but for the specific circumstances, would normally be covered by the Convention.\n",
              "Article 56 enables a Contracting State to declare that the Convention shall extend to all or any of the territories for whose international relations the State is responsible.\n",
              "Thus, implicitly and paradoxically, the principle of effective territorial control does not appear to apply automatically to such territories see also Bui van Thanh v United Kingdom (1990) 33 Yearbook of the European Convention on Human Rights 59 at p 61; Loizidou v Turkey at paras 86 87; Yonghong v Portugal Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1999 IX, pp 385, 391 392.\n",
              "The Court rejected the suggestion that extra territorial acts could bring individuals within the jurisdiction for the purposes of some Convention rights but not others.\n",
              "It said at para 75: the court is of the view that the wording of article 1 does not provide any support for the applicants suggestion that the positive obligation in article 1 to secure the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention can be divided and tailored in accordance with the particular circumstances of the extra territorial act in question and, it considers its view in this respect supported by the text of article 19 of the Convention.\n",
              "Indeed the applicants approach does not explain the application of the words within their jurisdiction in article 1 and it even goes so far as to render those words superfluous and devoid of any purpose.\n",
              "Had the drafters of the Convention wished to ensure jurisdiction as extensive as that advocated by the applicants, they could have adopted a text the same as or similar to the contemporaneous articles 1 of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949.\n",
              "I shall describe this as the whole package principle.\n",
              "The Court singled out for special mention as an example of an exceptional case of extra territorial jurisdiction that fell within article 1, the case of Drozd and Janousek v France and Spain (1992) 14 EHRR 745.\n",
              "I shall consider this decision in due course.\n",
              "The Court noted a number of other examples of States exercising extra territorial jurisdiction, implying, I believe, that those affected would be within the jurisdiction of the State in question within the meaning of article 1: Additionally, the Court notes that other recognised instances of the extra territorial exercise of jurisdiction by a state include cases involving the activities of its diplomatic or consular agents abroad and on board craft and vessels registered in, or flying the flag of, that state.\n",
              "In these specific situations, customary international law and treaty provisions have recognised the extra territorial exercise of jurisdiction by the relevant state.\n",
              "The applicants in Bankovic also relied on two admissibility decisions that proceeded on a different basis of article 1 jurisdiction that has been described as state agent authority, namely de facto control by state agents of persons as opposed to territory, Issa v Turkey (Application No 31821/96) (unreported) 30 May 2000 and calan v Turkey (Application No 46221/99) (unreported) 14 December 2000.\n",
              "The Grand Chamber swept these aside with the comment that in neither case was the issue of jurisdiction raised by the respondent Government, adding that the merits of those cases had yet to be decided.\n",
              "The respondent Governments in Bankovic, including the United Kingdom, had in fact accepted the existence of jurisdiction in those cases on the basis that it was the assertion or exercise of legal authority, actual or purported, over persons owing some form of allegiance to that state or who have been brought within that states control.\n",
              "Mr Eadie QC, for the Secretary of State, has not in this Court accepted any general principle whereby article 1 jurisdiction can be based on the exercise of control by State agents over individuals as opposed to territory.\n",
              "It is convenient at this point to consider the treatment by the Strasbourg Court of the question of jurisdiction on the substantive hearings in those two cases.\n",

              "In calan (2005) 41 EHRR 985 the applicant, a Turk, was handed over to Turkish officials aboard a Turkish aircraft at Nairobi.\n",
              "At the substantive hearing, following that before the Court (2003) 37 EHRR 238, the Grand Chamber recorded at para 91 that it was common ground that, directly after being handed over to the Turkish officials by the Kenyan officials, the applicant was under effective Turkish authority and therefore within the jurisdiction of that state for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention, even though in this instance Turkey exercised its authority outside its territory.\n",
              "It is true that the applicant was physically forced to return to Turkey by Turkish officials and was under their authority and control following his arrest and return to Turkey.\n",
              "The substantive hearing in Issa (2004) 41 EHRR 567 took place before the Second Section, three members of which had been party to the decision in Bankovic.\n",

              "The claim failed because they were unable to prove this.\n",
              "The Court had, however, permitted Turkey to challenge the existence of article 1 jurisdiction, albeit that no challenge on this ground had been made at the admissibility hearing.\n",
              "The Court at paras 68 69 referred to the substantive decision in Loizidou v Turkey (1996) 23 EHRR 513, para 52 for the proposition that: According to the relevant principles of international law, a States responsibility may be engaged where, as a consequence of military action whether lawful or unlawful that State in practice exercises effective control of an area situated outside its national territory.\n",
              "The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention derives from the fact of such control, whether it be exercised directly, through its armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration.\n",
              "The Court went on to say, at para 71: Moreover, a State may also be held accountable for violation of the Convention rights and freedoms of persons who are in the territory of another State but who are found to be under the former States authority and control through its agents operating whether lawfully or unlawfully in the latter State.(Citations omitted).\n",

              "The implications of the Strasbourg Courts decision in Bankovic received detailed analysis in Al Skeini in the Divisional Court, the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords.\n",

              "So far as concerns the second question, the ambit of article 1 had been exhaustively considered by the Divisional Court [2004] EWHC 2911 (Admin); [2007] QB 140 which had analysed chronologically all the relevant Strasbourg authorities, including Bankovic.\n",
              "The court concluded that these established that the primary meaning of within their jurisdiction in article 1 was within the territorial jurisdiction of the contracting States, subject to a number of exceptions.\n",
              "There was no general exception whereby those subject to the exercise of state agent authority fell within the article 1 jurisdiction of the State.\n",
              "Insofar as Issa had held to the contrary, it should be disregarded as inconsistent with the decision in Bankovic.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal [2005] EWCA Civ 1609; [2007] QB 140 differed on the last point, holding that Issa was authoritative and demonstrated that article 1 jurisdiction was established by the exercise of control over individuals by State agents, both within and outside the jurisdiction of contracting States.\n",
              "The House of Lords preferred the reasoning of the Divisional Court.\n",
              "The majority approached the issue of article 1 jurisdiction on the footing that this was essentially a matter for the Strasbourg court and the House should not construe article 1 as having any further reach than that established by that Court.\n",
              "As to that pre eminence should be given to the decision of the Grand Chamber in Bankovic.\n",
              "The House was, however, faced with the fact that, so far as Mr Baha Mousa was concerned, the Secretary of State had accepted that, because he died as a result of misconduct that took place at a detention centre within a British military base, he met his death within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for the purposes of article 1.\n",
              "The claimants sought to rely on a principle of state agent authority, arguing that if such authority was exercised over individuals, this brought them within the jurisdiction for purposes of article 1.\n",
              "The majority was troubled by the fact that some statements of the Court in Issa were hard to reconcile with Bankovic, and particularly with the whole package principle.\n",
              "Insofar as Issa could not be reconciled with Bankovic, the majority held that it should be disregarded.\n",
              "Thus Lord Rodger held, at para 79: the whole package of rights applies and must be secured where a contracting state has jurisdiction.\n",
              "This merely reflects the normal understanding that a contracting state cannot pick and choose among the rights in the Convention: it must secure them all to everyone within its jurisdiction.\n",
              "If that is so, then it suggests that the obligation under article 1 can arise only where the contracting state has such effective control of the territory of another state that it could secure to everyone in the territory all the rights and freedoms in section 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "Lord Brown carried out a detailed analysis of the Strasbourg jurisprudence.\n",
              "He recognised some narrow categories where the Strasbourg Court had found article 1 jurisdiction in circumstances where the State had not got territorial control irregular extradition such as calan and activities of embassies and consulates.\n",
              "These exceptions apart, Lord Brown considered the whole package principle to be of importance: 128.\n",
              "There is one other central objection to the creation of the wide basis of jurisdiction here contended for by the appellants under the rubric control and authority, going beyond that arising in any of the narrowly recognised categories already discussed and yet short of that arising from the effective control of territory within the Council of Europe area.\n",
              "Bankovic (and later Assanidze) stands, as stated, for the indivisible nature of article 1 jurisdiction: it cannot be divided and tailored.\n",
              "As Bankovic had earlier pointed out, at para 40: the applicants interpretation of jurisdiction would invert and divide the positive obligation on contracting states to secure the substantive rights in a manner never contemplated by article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "When, moreover, the Convention applies, it operates as a living instrument. calan provides an example of this, a recognition that the interpretation of article 2 has been modified consequent on the territories encompassed by the member states of the Council of Europe [having] become a zone free of capital punishment: para 195. (Paras 64 and 65 of Bankovic, I may note, contrast on the one hand the Conventions substantive provisions and the competence of the Convention organs, to both of which the living instrument approach applies and, on the other hand, the scope of article 1 the scope and reach of the entire Convention to which it does not.) Bear in mind too the rigour with which the court applies the Convention, well exemplified by the series of cases from the conflict zone of south eastern Turkey in which, the states difficulties notwithstanding, no dilution has been permitted of the investigative obligations arising under articles 2 and 3. 129.\n",
              "The point is this: except where a state really does have effective control of territory, it cannot hope to secure Convention rights within that territory and, unless it is within the area of the Council of Europe, it is unlikely in any event to find certain of the Convention rights it is bound to secure reconcilable with the customs of the resident population.\n",
              "Applying Bankovic, the majority held that the five Iraqi citizens who had been killed in Basra were not within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for the purposes of article 1.\n",
              "Lord Brown indicated that he would recognise the United Kingdoms jurisdiction over Mr Baha Mousa only on the basis of an analogy with the extra territorial exception made for embassies.\n",
              "However, in a subsequent admissibility decision in Al Saadoon and Mufdhi v United Kingdom (2009) 49 EHRR SE 95 the Strasbourg Court has held that detainees in British detention centres in Iraq fell within United Kingdom jurisdiction by reason of the total and exclusive de facto, and subsequently de jure, control exercised by the United Kingdom authorities over the premises in question. (para 88)\n",
              "A more recent example of where the Strasbourg Court has equated control over individuals with article 1 jurisdiction is the decision of the Grand Chamber in Medvedyev and others v France (Application No 3394/03) judgment delivered on 29 March 2010.\n",
              "On the high seas a French warship boarded a merchant vessel, crewed by the applicants who were suspected of being engaged in drug smuggling and compulsorily escorted it on a 13 day voyage into Brest.\n",
              "The court held at para 67 that as the vessel and its crew were, at least de facto, under the control of France, they were effectively under Frances jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1.\n",
              "This decision, when added to that in Issa suggests that the Strasbourg Court may be prepared to found article 1 jurisdiction on state agent authority, even though this principle does not seem consistent with the approach in Bankovic.\n",
              "Gentle\n",
              "The possibility that British soldiers serving abroad were within the article 1 jurisdiction of the United Kingdom because they were under the authority of the United Kingdom was shortly dismissed by Lord Bingham in R (Gentle) v Prime Minister [2008] AC 1356.\n",
              "He said, at para 8: (3) The obligation of member states under article 1 of the Convention is to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms in the Convention.\n",
              "Subject to limited exceptions and specific extensions, the application of the Convention is territorial: the rights and freedoms are ordinarily to be secured to those within the borders of the state and not outside.\n",
              "Here, the deaths of Fusilier Gentle and Trooper Clarke occurred in Iraq and although they were subject to the authority of the defendants they were clearly not within the jurisdiction of the UK as that expression in the Convention has been interpreted: R (Al Skeini) v Secretary of State for Defence [2008] AC 153, paras 79, 129.\n",
              "The other members of the House expressed general agreement with Lord Bingham.\n",
              "Article 1 jurisdiction was not, however, at the heart of the case, to the extent that the Court of Appeal, whose decision was upheld, had not found it necessary to decide the point.\n",
              "Gentle nonetheless lends support to the analysis of the House of Lords in Al Skeini.\n",
              "The claimants in Al Skeini have taken their case to Strasbourg and this will give the Strasbourg Court a further opportunity to clarify this difficult area of its jurisprudence.\n",
              "Submissions\n",
              "For the Secretary of State, Mr Eadie submitted that Private Smith was only within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom when he was within territory that was under the effective control of the United Kingdom.\n",
              "On this basis he conceded that article 2 had applied during those periods when Private Smith was within the military base, which included the time of his death.\n",
              "When, however, he was not within territory controlled by the United Kingdom, he was not within article 1 jurisdiction.\n",
              "His position in those circumstances did not fall within any of the recognised exceptions to the general principle that article 1 jurisdiction was territorial.\n",
              "In so submitting he relied in particular on Bankovic, Al Skeini and Gentle.\n",
              "For Mrs Smith Miss Dinah Rose QC made it clear that her case was not based on Private Smith having been on territory under the de facto control of the United Kingdom, nor upon Private Smith himself having been under the de facto control of the Army, as a State agent, but upon the fact that Private Smith was subject to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom as a matter of both domestic and international law.\n",
              "He was so subject by reason of his status as a member of the Armed Forces.\n",
              "Miss Rose submitted that soldiers were in the same position as other State agents, such as diplomats, consular agents and judges.\n",
              "When exercising State powers outside the territory of the State they themselves remained subject to the jurisdiction of the State.\n",
              "Mr Beloff QC appeared for the Intervener, the Equality and Human Rights Commission.\n",
              "He supported Miss Roses submissions.\n",
              "He submitted that the authorities dealing with control of territory, or control of persons, did not touch on the basis of jurisdiction asserted in this case.\n",
              "That was personal jurisdiction, which, to quote from para 17 of his written case, does not depend on a persons location.\n",
              "It is founded on the reciprocal rights and obligations of nationals and their state, wherever they may be.\n",
              "Mr Beloff accepted that the precise question of whether article 1 jurisdiction could be founded on this basis had not arisen before the Strasbourg Court.\n",
              "The decision of the Court of Appeal.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal held that article 1 required the existence of a jurisdictional link and that this requirement was satisfied in the case of Private Smith, for the reasons set out in para 29 of its judgment.\n",
              "Members of the armed forces were: subject to United Kingdom military law without territorial limit and may be tried by court martial whether the offence is committed in England or elsewhere.\n",
              "They are also subject to the general criminal and civil law.\n",
              "Soldiers serve abroad as a result of and pursuant to the exercise of United Kingdom jurisdiction over them.\n",
              "Thus the legality of their presence and of their actions depends on their being subject to United Kingdom jurisdiction and complying with United Kingdom law.\n",
              "As a matter of international law, no infringement of the sovereignty of the host state is involved in the United Kingdom exercising jurisdiction over its soldiers serving abroad.\n",
              "The Court was also influenced by what it perceived as the illogicality of holding that Private Smith was within the jurisdiction when on military premises, but not when outside them: it is accepted that a British soldier is protected by the 1998 Act and the Convention when he is at a military base.\n",
              "In our judgment, it makes no sense to hold that he is not so protected when in an ambulance or in a truck or in the street or in the desert.\n",
              "There is no sensible reason for not holding that there is a sufficient link between the solider as victim and the United Kingdom whether he is at a base or not.\n",
              "So too, if he is court martialled for an act committed in Iraq, he should be entitled to the protection of article 6 of the Convention wherever the court martial takes place.\n",
              "The meaning of jurisdiction\n",
              "interpretation.\n",
              "The first is that: Article 31 of the Vienna Treaty lays down a number of general rules of A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n",
              "Jurisdiction has more than one ordinary meaning.\n",
              "The meanings given by the Shorter Oxford Dictionary include the following: 1.\n",
              "Exercise of judicial authority, or of the functions of a judge or legal tribunal; power of administering law or justice.\n",
              "Also, power or authority in general. 2.\n",
              "The extent or range of judicial or administrative power; the territory over which such power extends.\n",
              "Jowetts Dictionary of English Law, 2nd ed (1977), after giving the primary\n",
              "meaning of legal authority goes on to state: Jurisdiction also signifies the district or geographical limits within which the judgments or orders of a court can be enforced or executed.\n",
              "This is sometimes called territorial jurisdiction.\n",
              "Thus the phrase within the jurisdiction can bear the natural meaning subject to the authority of but can equally bear the natural meaning within the territory over which authority is exercised.\n",
              "There are different varieties of authority that can be described as jurisdiction.\n",
              "Oppenheims International Law, 9th ed (1992), vol 1, describes these and their relationship to territorial jurisdiction: 136 State jurisdiction in general State jurisdiction concerns essentially the extent of each states right to regulate conduct or the consequences of events.\n",
              "In practice jurisdiction is not a single concept.\n",
              "A states jurisdiction may take various forms.\n",
              "Thus a state may regulate conduct by legislation; or it may, through its courts, regulate those differences which come before them, whether arising out of the civil or criminal law; or it may regulate conduct by taking executive or administrative action which impinges more directly on the course of events, as by enforcing its laws or the decisions of its courts.\n",
              "The extent of a states jurisdiction may differ in each of these contexts.\n",
              "The jurisdiction concerns both international law and the internal law of each state.\n",
              "The former determines the permissible limits of a states jurisdiction in the various forms it may take, while the latter prescribes the extent to which, and manner in which, the state in fact asserts its jurisdiction. 137 Territorial jurisdiction As all persons and things within the territory of a state fall under its territorial authority, each state normally has jurisdiction legislative, curial and executive over them.\n",
              "Territoriality is the primary basis for jurisdiction; 138 Jurisdiction over citizens abroad International law does not prevent a state from exercising jurisdiction, within its own territory, over its nationals travelling or residing abroad, since they remain under its personal authority.\n",
              "Accordingly, it may legislate with regard to their conduct when abroad, levy taxes in respect of their assets or earnings abroad, or legislate in respect of their foreign property.\n",
              "In all such cases, however, the states power to enforce its laws depends upon its national being in, or returning to, its territory or having there property against which they can be enforced.\n",
              "Most human rights can only be the subject of protection, or interference, by the State if the individual who enjoys them is within the administrative, or executive, authority of the State.\n",
              "This is obviously true of the rights that protect the person, namely those protected by articles 2, 3 4 and 5 and is also true of articles 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.\n",
              "Save in exceptional circumstances those requiring State protection of these rights will be within the territorial jurisdiction of the State in question.\n",
              "In respect of these rights it produces a perfectly sensible result to interpret within their jurisdiction in article 1 as meaning within the territorial jurisdiction of the Member States.\n",
              "Public international law recognises that both legislative and judicial authority can be exercised over individuals whether they are inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the State.\n",
              "The exercise of these types of jurisdiction may well have potential impact on some human rights, but not on others.\n",
              "The Strasbourg Court appears to have recognised, at least implicitly, that the exercise of these types of jurisdiction can bring those who are subject to them within the jurisdiction for purposes of article 1, whether or not they are within the territorial jurisdiction of the State, in relation to those rights that are affected.\n",
              "In such circumstances there can be no question of the whole package principle applying.\n",
              "I shall give a number of examples.\n",
              "Article 6 protects the right to a fair trial.\n",
              "The English court exercises extra territorial jurisdiction in defined circumstances in relation to civil claims.\n",
              "If a foreigner resident abroad is impleaded by a resident of this country in the English court, it is hard to believe that the Strasbourg Court would hold the English claimant entitled to the benefit of article 6 but the foreign defendant not so entitled.\n",
              "Both would be within the judicial jurisdiction of the English court and there would seem a strong case for equating that with article 1 jurisdiction in the context of the application of article 6.\n",
              "Such an approach would seem implicitly to have been accepted by the Strasbourg Court in plenary session in Drozd and Janousek v France and Spain (1992) 14 EHRR 745.\n",
              "The applicants in that case had been tried in criminal proceedings in Andorra by a Tribunal, presided over by a French judge.\n",
              "Andorra was not party to the Convention.\n",
              "The applicants complained, none the less, of violation of their article 6 rights to a fair trial.\n",
              "The Court held that the judge had not been sitting in his capacity as a French judge, but as an Andorran judge, but appears to have accepted that had this not been so the applicants would have fallen within the jurisdiction of France for the purposes of article 1 in relation to their article 6 rights.\n",
              "This would not, however, have entitled them to claim against France the benefit of protection of the rest of the Convention rights.\n",
              "What of the property rights protected by article 1 of the First Protocol? Many foreign residents own property in this country.\n",
              "Are they within the jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1? In Carson v United Kingdom (Application No 42184/05) judgment 16 March 2010 the Grand Chamber ruled admissible claims against the United Kingdom by 13 persons entitled to British State pensions for violation of article 14 of the Convention in combination with article 1 of the First Protocol.\n",
              "All the claimants had earned pensions by working in Britain, but had emigrated to South Africa, Australia or Canada on retirement.\n",
              "The report states, in para 1 that they were all British nationals, but para 21 states that one of them remained an Australian national.\n",
              "The basis of the claim was discrimination against the claimants in that their pensions were not linked to United Kingdom inflation, in contrast to the position of pensioners resident within the United Kingdom.\n",
              "Neither before the English courts nor before the Strasbourg Court was there any discussion of the basis upon which the claimants were treated as within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for the purposes of article 1.\n",
              "One possible answer is that because their pension rights were governed by legislation, they fell within the legislative jurisdiction of the United Kingdom in relation to those rights.\n",
              "There could be no question, however, of the United Kingdom having to afford them protection in relation to the whole package of Convention rights.\n",
              "In X v United Kingdom (1979) 15 DR 137, the Commission ruled inadmissible on the merits a claim by a British citizen, who was employed by the European Commission and resident in Brussels, for violation of article 1 of the Convention in combination with article 3 of the First Protocol.\n",
              "She complained that she had no right to vote in United Kingdom elections whereas members of the diplomatic service and the Armed Forces stationed outside the United Kingdom retained their right to vote.\n",
              "The Commission held that the discrimination was justified in that these persons were not voluntarily abroad but had been sent abroad to serve their country.\n",
              "They fell to be regarded as resident citizens, in contrast to the applicant who was living abroad voluntarily.\n",
              "It was not, however, suggested that the applicant did not fall within the article 1 jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.\n",
              "The basis for this jurisdiction was perhaps that, in relation to voting rights, nationals fall within the jurisdiction of their own State, whether or not they are within the territorial jurisdiction.\n",
              "There are other cases that suggest that where one State delegates to another State authority to control a particular area of government that engages one of the Convention rights, those subject to the exercise of the latter States authority will be deemed to be within the jurisdiction of the latter State for the purposes of article 1 in relation to that right: Drozd; X and Y v Switzerland (1977) 9 DR 57; Gentilhomme, Schaff Benhadji and Zerouki v France (Application Nos 48205/99, 48207/99, 48209/99) (unreported) 14 May 2002.\n",
              "A recent decision of the Strasbourg Court provides a variation on this theme.\n",
              "In Stephen v Malta (No 1) (2009) 50 EHRR 144 the applicant was a British subject who had been arrested and detained in Spain pursuant to an arrest warrant that had been issued by a Maltese Court that had not been competent to issue it.\n",
              "The Strasbourg Court, of its own motion, considered article 1 jurisdiction.\n",
              "It remarked at para 45: the question to be decided is whether the facts complained of by the applicant can be attributed to Malta The Court gave an affirmative answer to this question and held that the applicants complaints under article 5 engaged the responsibility of Malta under the Convention.\n",
              "No principled explanation was given for this departure from the territorial approach to article 1 jurisdiction other than the passage quoted above which, if applied generally, would render that approach nugatory.\n",
              "These cases might be thought to support a general principle that there will be jurisdiction under article 1 whenever a State exercises authority, be it legislative, judicial or executive, which affects a Convention right of a person, whether that person is within the territory of that State or not.\n",
              "So far as the exercise of executive authority is concerned, one can postulate that this requires effective control, either of territory or of individuals, before article 1 jurisdiction is established.\n",
              "The fact remains, however, that the Strasbourg Court has not propounded any such general principle.\n",
              "Nor can such a principle readily be reconciled with the proposition, approved in Bankovic, that article 1 jurisdiction is essentially territorial in nature and that other bases of jurisdiction are exceptional and require special justification in the particular circumstances of each case.\n",
              "There are compelling reasons for following the approach of the Grand Chamber in Bankovic, quite apart from the reasons that led the House of Lords to treat it as a landmark decision.\n",
              "The travaux to which the Court referred demonstrate that the contracting States were concerned with the manner in which those within their territories were treated.\n",
              "It is not credible that the change to the phrase within their jurisdiction was intended to effect a fundamental extension to the scope of the Convention without this being clearly reflected in the travaux.\n",
              "The question then is whether, applying the original meaning principle, it is right to include a States armed forces abroad as falling within the jurisdiction of the State for purposes of article 1 by reason of the special status that they enjoy.\n",
              "That is the proposition that Miss Rose advances and it is one that is, as the Grand Chamber pointed out in Bankovic, not reflected by State practice.\n",
              "It is, furthermore, almost wholly unsupported by Strasbourg jurisprudence.\n",
              "decision of the Commission in Cyprus v Turkey (1975) 2 DR 125: I say almost having regard to the following passage in the admissibility 8The Commission further observes that nationals of a State, including registered ships and aircrafts, are partly within its jurisdiction wherever they may be, and that authorised agents of a State, including diplomatic or consular agents and armed forces, not only remain under its jurisdiction when abroad but bring any other persons or property within the jurisdiction of that State, to the extent that they exercise authority over such persons or property.\n",
              "Insofar as, by their acts or omissions, they affect such persons or property, the responsibility of the State is engaged.\n",
              "I am not aware of any other Strasbourg jurisprudence that suggests that armed forces remain under the jurisdiction of a State when abroad and the reasoning of the Commission in this case was far wider than that of the Court when dealing with Turkeys jurisdiction in Northern Cyprus in Loizidou v Turkey (1995) 20 EHRR 99.\n",
              "Miss Rose drew attention to Strasbourg jurisprudence that holds that those affected by the conduct of a States diplomatic and consular officials abroad can fall within the jurisdiction of the State, which was applied by the Court of Appeal in R (B and others) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2004] EWCA Civ 1344; [2005] QB 643.\n",
              "She submitted that it followed from this that such officials were themselves within the jurisdiction of their States and that the same principle should apply to the armed forces.\n",
              "I have some difficulty with the logic of the proposition that State agents whose acts bring those affected by them within article 1 jurisdiction must, in consequence, themselves also be within the article 1 jurisdiction of the State whose agents they are but, more fundamentally, it does not seem to me that the analogy between diplomatic and consular officials and members of the armed forces is compelling.\n",
              "More compelling were the points made by Miss Rose in relation to the unique status of members of the armed forces.\n",
              "When the Convention was agreed men who were British citizens were liable to conscription under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1948 and, in consequence of conscription, rendered subject to the executive authority of the armed forces and to the legislative and judicial regimes that applied to the armed forces.\n",
              "A similar situation no doubt existed in the case of other contracting States.\n",
              "Today the same is true of those who volunteer to serve in the armed forces see the description of the relevant legislation set out by Lord Mance in his judgment at para 190.\n",
              "Under domestic law and in accordance with public international law, members of the armed forces remain under the legislative, judicial and executive authority of the United Kingdom, whether serving within or outside United Kingdom territory.\n",
              "From the viewpoint of domestic law they can thus be said to be within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom wherever they are.\n",
              "It is not attractive to postulate that, when they are outside the territorial jurisdiction in the service of their country they lose the protection afforded by the Convention and the HRA.\n",
              "That, however, is not the question.\n",
              "The question is whether, in concluding the Convention, the contracting States agreed that article 1 jurisdiction should extend to armed forces when serving abroad as an exception to the essentially territorial nature of that jurisdiction.\n",
              "What were the practical implications of so doing?\n",
              "It is not wholly realistic to consider the perceived implications of the application of the Convention in 1953 by reference to the requirements of the Convention, that have been identified by the Strasbourg Court since 1953.\n",
              "In particular, it is perhaps not realistic to apply to conditions in 1953 the positive obligations in relation to article 2 that have quite recently been laid down by the Strasbourg Court.\n",
              "It is nonetheless instructive to consider the implications of applying the Convention to armed forces serving abroad.\n",
              "It is not practicable for a State to secure many of the Convention rights and freedoms for troops in active service abroad.\n",
              "Article 2 is, however, plainly capable of being engaged.\n",
              "The safety of the lives of those fighting abroad can depend critically on the acts or omissions of State agents, covering the equipment with which they are supplied, the missions on which they are sent, and strategic and tactical decisions taken by commanders in the field.\n",
              "If the troops are within the article 1 jurisdiction of the State the question arises of how far these matters fall within the substantive obligations imposed by article 2.\n",
              "Insofar as they do, the question then arises of whether the procedural obligation arises every time a serviceman is killed in circumstances which may involve a shortcoming in the performance of those substantive obligations.\n",
              "These are questions that I shall explore when addressing the Inquest Issue.\n",
              "The Convention was agreed in the aftermath of a global conflict in which millions of troops had been deployed.\n",
              "In 1944 the United Kingdom had over 4.5 million troops serving.\n",
              "British casualties in the war numbered about 330,000.\n",
              "By 1950 the number of British troops in service had reduced to about 700,000, many of whom were conscripts.\n",
              "While the Convention was being negotiated the Korean War was in progress.\n",
              "British casualties in that war numbered about 700.\n",
              "Derogation is permitted under article 15 in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation, although there can be no derogation from article 2 except in respect of deaths resulting from lawful acts of war.\n",
              "No derogation was made, and troops were deployed abroad in circumstances falling short of those permitting derogation under article 15.\n",
              "The contracting States might well not have contemplated that the application of article 2 to troop operations abroad would have involved obligations such as those I have discussed above, but whatever the implications might have seemed, it is unlikely that they would have appeared a desirable consequence of the Convention.\n",
              "So far as this country is concerned, it is significant that when the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 rendered the Crown susceptible to civil suit an exception was made in relation to the armed forces.\n",
              "Only in 1987 did the Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act remove that exception.\n",
              "This does not lie happily with the proposition that the United Kingdom bound itself to the observance of the Convention obligations toward its armed forces abroad when it ratified the Convention in 1951.\n",
              "Today the size of the forces maintained by contracting States is a fraction of those that they maintained when the Convention was agreed.\n",
              "Every death of a British serviceman abroad is now reported in the British press.\n",
              "The bodies of British servicemen who die on active service are flown back and buried in this country, and it is this fact which makes it mandatory to hold an inquest in each case.\n",
              "The care that is taken to avoid casualties and the procedures that are followed when casualties occur are to be commended, but they would not have seemed practicable in 1953.\n",
              "In Al Skeini at para 107 Lord Brown expressed the view that the House should not construe article 1 as reaching any further than the existing Strasbourg jurisprudence clearly shows it to reach.\n",
              "I endorse that comment.\n",
              "We are here dealing with the scope of the Convention and exploring principles that apply to all contracting States.\n",
              "The contention that a States armed forces, by reason of their personal status, fall within the jurisdiction of the State for the purposes of article 1 is novel.\n",
              "I do not believe that the principles to be derived from the Strasbourg jurisprudence, conflicting as some of them are, clearly demonstrate that the contention is correct.\n",
              "The proper tribunal to resolve this issue is the Strasbourg Court itself, and it will have the opportunity to do so when it considers Al Skeini.\n",
              "For these reasons I would hold that the Court of Appeal should not have held that Private Smith was within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom within the meaning of article 1 at times when he was not within premises under the effective control of the army.\n",
              "This conclusion, and the reasoning that has led to it, accords with the comprehensive analysis of the relevant jurisprudence in the judgment of Lord Collins.\n",

              "The Inquest Issue\n",
              "The nature of the issue\n",
              "The Inquest Issue arises on the premise that Private Smith was within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom within the meaning of article 1 at the time of the events that led to his death, so that he was entitled to the protection of article 2 of the Convention.\n",
              "Article 2 of the Convention provides: 1.\n",
              "Everyones right to life shall be protected by law.\n",
              "No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.\n",
              "In R (Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner [2004] UKHL 10; [2004] 2 AC 182 the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, in a considered opinion, summarised the Strasbourg jurisprudence as to the effect of this provision: 2.\n",
              "The European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly interpreted article 2 of the European Convention as imposing on member states substantive obligations not to take life without justification and also to establish a framework of laws, precautions, procedures and means of enforcement which will, to the greatest extent reasonably practicable, protect life. 3.\n",
              "The European Court has also interpreted article 2 as imposing on member states a procedural obligation to initiate an effective public investigation by an independent official body into any death occurring in circumstances in which it appears that one or other of the foregoing substantive obligations has been, or may have been, violated and it appears that agents of the state are, or may be, in some way implicated (references omitted).\n",
              "The Inquest Issue is concerned with the procedural obligation.\n",
              "The procedural obligation requires a State, of its own motion, to carry out an investigation into a death that has the following features: i) It must have a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results. ii) It must be conducted by a tribunal that is independent of the state agents who may bear some responsibility for the death. iii) The relatives of the deceased must be able to play an appropriate part in it. iv) It must be prompt and effective.\n",
              "This means that it must perform its essential purposes.\n",
              "These are to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and to ensure the accountability of state agents or bodies for deaths occurring under their responsibility.\n",
              "These features are derived from the Strasbourg jurisprudence, as analysed in Middleton and R (L (A Patient)) v Secretary of State for Justice [2008] UKHL 68; [2009] AC 588.\n",
              "I shall describe an investigation that has these features as an article 2 investigation.\n",
              "The procedural obligation implicit in article 2 was first recognised by the Strasbourg Court in McCann v United Kingdom (1995) 21 EHRR 97.\n",
              "Since then the Court has repeatedly found such an obligation to have existed, but always in the context of a case in which the respondent State has been held to have been in breach of a substantive obligation imposed by article 2.\n",
              "This is no doubt because complaints of violation of the procedural obligation of article 2 are only likely to be brought by relatives before the Strasbourg Court where these are ancillary to complaints of substantive breaches of article 2.\n",
              "It has been stated on a number of occasions that the procedural obligation under article 2 is parasitic upon the existence of the article 2 substantive right and cannot exist independently see, for example, Lord Binghams observations at para 6 of Gentle.\n",
              "The Inquest Issue has been formulated in the agreed Statement of Facts and Issues as follows: Whether the fresh inquest into Private Smiths death must conform with the procedural obligation implied into Article 2 of the Convention.\n",
              "In the first inquest the Coroner gave a narrative verdict which included the finding that Private Smiths death was caused by a serious failure to recognise and take appropriate steps to address the difficulty that he had in adjusting to the climate.\n",
              "Subsequently, on 5 January 2007 the Coroner gave a ruling holding that the requirements of article 2 did not apply to the inquest because any shortcomings related to a failure to follow the procedures that should have applied and not to any defects in those procedures, so that there was no question of any substantive breach of article 2.\n",
              "The basis upon which Mrs Smith has successfully challenged this ruling has raised an important issue of principle.\n",
              "Both Miss Rose and Mr Beloff have contended that an article 2 investigation must be held whenever a member of the armed services dies on active service and the Court of Appeal has so found.\n",
              "The argument has proceeded on the following basis.\n",
              "There are two different types of inquest.\n",
              "The first has the features that the Court of Appeal identified in R v Coroner for North Humberside and Scunthorpe, Ex p Jamieson [1995] QB 1 (a Jamieson inquest).\n",
              "The second has the features that the House of Lords identified in R (Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner [2004] UKHL 10; [2004] 2 AC 182 (a Middleton inquest).\n",
              "If the requirements of article 2 apply, the coroner must conduct a Middleton inquest.\n",
              "The Middleton inquest will address any alleged failures on the part of the State to comply with the substantive obligations imposed by article 2.\n",
              "Before addressing the Inquest Issue directly I propose to explain a number of reservations that I have in relation to the procedural obligation: i) I do not see how the procedural obligation can work if it is limited to an obligation to hold an article 2 investigation if, and only if, there are grounds for suspecting a breach by the State of a substantive article 2 obligation. ii) I question the extent of the distinction between a Jamieson inquest and a Middleton inquest. iii) There is a major difficulty in identifying the substantive obligations that article 2 imposes on a State in relation to the safety of its armed forces. iv) I question the extent to which an inquest, even a Middleton inquest, will necessarily be an appropriate process for discharging the procedural obligation.\n",
              "The duty to investigate death\n",
              "The duty to hold an article 2 investigation arises where there are grounds for suspecting that a death may involve breach by the State of one of the substantive obligations imposed by article 2.\n",
              "This raises the question of how the State is to identify that there are grounds for such suspicion.\n",
              "Any effective scheme for protecting the right to life must surely require a staged system of investigation of deaths, under which the first stage takes place automatically in relation to every death, whether or not there are grounds for suspecting that there is anything untoward about the death.\n",
              "Where the first stage shows that the death has not, or may not have, resulted from natural causes, there will be a requirement for a further stage or stages of the investigation.\n",
              "The requirement for an article 2 investigation will only arise if the preceding stage of the investigation discloses that there is a possibility that the State has not complied with a substantive article 2 obligation.\n",
              "In the United Kingdom such a staged system of investigating deaths exists.\n",
              "All deaths are required to be registered under the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953.\n",
              "Registration requires a death certificate certifying the cause of death from a doctor or coroner.\n",
              "Where there is doubt as to whether the death is due to natural causes, it will be reported to a coroner.\n",
              "He then decides whether further enquiries need to be carried out.\n",
              "These may take the form of a post mortem examination or an inquest.\n",
              "Section 8 of the Coroners Act 1988 requires a coroner to hold an inquest where the body of a person is lying within his district and there is reasonable cause to suspect that the deceased has died a violent or an unnatural death, has died a sudden death of which the cause is unknown or has died in prison or in such place or in such circumstances as to require an inquest under any other Act.\n",
              "The inquest was designed to perform a fact finding role.\n",
              "It was not intended necessarily to be the final stage of the investigation.\n",
              "Its mandate expressly excludes determining civil or criminal liability.\n",
              "It is, however, being used as the appropriate process for determining whether there has been a violation of the States article 2 obligations.\n",
              "Jamieson and Middleton Inquests\n",
              "Jamieson involved an application for judicial review brought by the brother of a man who had hanged himself in his prison cell.\n",
              "The report of the case suggests that the evidence adduced at the inquest of the prisoner covered in detail the circumstances that led up to his suicide.\n",
              "It was the applicants case that the prison authorities were aware of the danger that his brother would commit suicide and failed to take the steps that they should have done to prevent this.\n",
              "He submitted to the coroner that he should direct the jury to consider whether the death of his brother was caused or contributed to by lack of care.\n",
              "The coroner refused to do so and it was this decision that was challenged by judicial review.\n",
              "The issue thus related, not to the scope of the investigation that had taken place, but as to the verdict that the jury were permitted to give.\n",
              "Sir Thomas Bingham MR, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, traced the statutory history of the coroners role and drew particular attention to the following statutory provisions, which are still in force.\n",
              "Under section 8(1) of the Coroners Act 1988 a coroner has to hold a inquest when a body is lying within his district and there is reason to think that the deceased has died a violent or unnatural death, or has died a sudden death of which the cause is unknown, or has died in prison or in such circumstances as to require an inquest under any other Act.\n",
              "Section 11(5)(b)(i) and (ii) requires the coroners jury to set out in an inquisition who the deceased was and how, when and where he came by his death.\n",
              "The Coroners Rules 1984 provide: 36(1) The proceedings and evidence at an inquest shall be directed solely to ascertaining the following matters, namely(a) who the deceased was; (b) how, when and where the deceased came by his death; (c) the particulars for the time being required by the Registration Acts to be registered concerning the death. (2) Neither the coroner nor the jury shall express any opinion on any other matters. 40.\n",
              "No person shall be allowed to address the coroner or the jury as to the facts. 41.\n",
              "Where the coroner sits with a jury, he shall sum up the evidence to the jury and direct them as to the law before they consider their verdict and shall draw their attention to rules 36(2) and 42. 42.\n",
              "No verdict shall be framed in such a way as to appear to determine any question of(a) criminal liability on the part of a named person, or (b) civil liability. 43.\n",
              "A coroner who believes that action should be taken to prevent the recurrence of fatalities similar to that in respect of which the inquest is being held may announce at the inquest that he is reporting the matter in writing to the person or authority who may have power to take such action and he may report the matter accordingly.\n",
              "In upholding the coroners ruling, the Court of Appeal set out a number of\n",
              "general principles, which included the following: (1) An inquest is a fact finding inquiry conducted by a coroner, with or without a jury, to establish reliable answers to four important but limited factual questions.\n",
              "The first of these relates to the identity of the deceased, the second to the place of his death, the third to the time of death.\n",
              "In most cases these questions are not hard to answer but in a minority of cases the answer may be problematical.\n",
              "The fourth question, and that to which evidence and inquiry are most often and most closely directed, relates to how the deceased came by his death.\n",
              "Rule 36 requires that the proceedings and evidence shall be directed solely to ascertaining these matters and forbids any expression of opinion on any other matter. (2) Both in section 11(5)(b)(ii) of the Act of 1988 and in rule 36(1)(b) of the Rules of 1984, how is to be understood as meaning by what means.\n",
              "It is noteworthy that the task is not to ascertain how the deceased died, which might raise general and far reaching issues, but howthe deceased came by his death, a more limited question directed to the means by which the deceased came by his death. (3) It is not the function of a coroner or his jury to determine, or appear to determine, any question of criminal or civil liability, to apportion guilt or attribute blame.\n",
              "Middleton also involved an inquest on a prisoner who had hanged himself in his cell.\n",
              "Similar allegations of neglect were made and once again the evidence covered the circumstances leading up to the deceaseds suicide.\n",
              "The jury handed the coroner a note stating that the Prison Service had failed in its duty of care to the deceased, but the coroner concluded that this could not be appended to the inquisition.\n",
              "The verdict was challenged on the ground (not open in Jamieson) that it did not comply with the procedural obligations of article 2.\n",
              "Lord Bingham, delivering the considered decision of the Committee, held that where article 2 was engaged it might be necessary, in accordance with section 3 of the Human Rights Act, to give the relevant statutory provisions a different meaning to that which the Court of Appeal had laid down in Jamieson.\n",
              "The change was not a big one: 35.\n",
              "Only one change is in our opinion needed: to interpret how in section 11(5)(b)(ii) of the Act and rule 36 (1)(b) of the Rules in the broader sense previously rejected, namely as meaning not simply by what means but by what means and in what circumstances. 36.\n",
              "This will not require a change of approach in some cases, where a traditional short form verdict will be quite satisfactory, but it will call for a change of approach in others (paras 30 31 above).\n",
              "In the latter class of case it must be for the coroner, in the exercise of his discretion, to decide how best, in the particular case, to elicit the jury's conclusion on the central issue or issues.\n",
              "The decision in Middleton has been given statutory effect by section 5 (2) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.\n",
              "That section provides: 5 Matters to be ascertained (1) The purpose of an investigation under this Part into a persons death is to ascertain (a) who the deceased was; (b) how, when and where the deceased came by his or her death; (c) the particulars (if any) required by the 1953 Act to be registered concerning the death. (2) Where necessary in order to avoid a breach of any Convention rights (within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998 (c 42)), the purpose mentioned in subsection (1)(b) is to be read as including the purpose of ascertaining in what circumstances the deceased came by his or her death. (3) Neither the senior coroner conducting an investigation under this Part into a persons death nor the jury (if there is one) may express any opinion on any matter other than (a) the questions mentioned in subsection (1)(a) and (b) (read with subsection (2) where applicable); (b) the particulars mentioned in subsection (1)(c).\n",
              "This is subject to paragraph 7 of Schedule 5.\n",
              "It seems to me that the only difference that the decision of the House in Middleton would have made to either the Jamieson inquest or the Middleton inquest would have been to the form of the verdict.\n",
              "In each case the Coroner appears to have permitted exploration of the relevant circumstances despite the fact that he did not permit these to be reflected in the verdict.\n",
              "I question whether there is, in truth, any difference in practice between a Jamieson and a Middleton inquest, other than the verdict.\n",
              "If there is, counsel were not in a position to explain it.\n",
              "Coroners appear frequently to have exercised considerable latitude as to the scope of the inquiry the inquest into the shootings in Gibraltar that were the subject of McCann v United Kingdom (1995) 21 EHRR 97 exemplifies this.\n",
              "The form of the verdict will, no doubt be dictated by the evidence that emerges at the inquest, but I have difficulty with the concept that the inquest itself may in midstream undergo a significant change in character from a Jamieson to a Middleton inquest.\n",
              "How far it is appropriate to widen the scope of an inquest in order to consider allegations of breach of obligations imposed by article 2 is a matter to which I shall revert.\n",
              "The substantive obligations of article 2 in relation to armed forces.\n",
              "If armed forces on active service abroad are within a States jurisdiction for purposes of article 1, the question arises of the scope of the substantive obligations imposed by article 2.\n",
              "Would the Strasbourg Court hold that they extend to the adequacy of the equipment with which the forces are provided; to the planning and execution of military manoeuvres? These questions are not easy to address, but an affirmative answer certainly cannot be excluded.\n",
              "McCann involved the shooting by an SAS unit of three members of the provisional IRA who were suspected of being about to detonate a bomb in Gibraltar.\n",
              "The Court held that article 2 imposed substantive duties in relation to the planning, execution and control of the operation, and a procedural obligation to investigate these matters in the light of the casualties.\n",
              "The Court adopted a similar approach to deaths that resulted from the operations of the Russian military when conducting substantial military operations against insurgents: Isayeva, Yusupova and Basayeva v Russia (Application Nos 57947 49/00) and Isayeva v Russia (Application No 57950/00), decisions of 24 February 2005.\n",
              "There would seem no reason why the Court might not adopt a similar approach to operations resulting in the death of a States own soldiers.\n",
              "The facts of this case do not require the Court to define the extent of the positive duty that article 2 imposes on a State in relation to its armed forces.\n",
              "How appropriate is an inquest for the discharge of article 2 procedural obligations?\n",
              "As I have pointed out, inquests were designed to perform a fact finding function as a stage in an overall scheme of investigation that would commence before the inquest and might continue after it.\n",
              "An inquest will not be the appropriate vehicle for all inquiries into State responsibility for loss of life.\n",
              "An inquest would not have been the appropriate means of determining whether the death of a victim of new variant CJD, contracted from eating BSE infected beef, involved government responsibility, nor for determining the issues of State responsibility for the Bloody Sunday killings.\n",
              "An inquest can properly conclude that a soldier died because a flack jacket was pierced by a snipers bullet.\n",
              "It does not seem to me, however, that it would be a satisfactory tribunal for investigating whether more effective flack jackets could and should have been supplied by the Ministry of Defence.\n",
              "If the article 2 obligation extends to considering the competence with which military manoeuvres have been executed, a coroners inquest cannot be the appropriate medium for the inquiry.\n",
              "Must an article 2 investigation be held whenever a member of the armed services dies on active service?\n",
              "Miss Rose argued that the State was under a positive obligation to take all reasonable steps to protect the lives of military recruits, who were subject to the authority and control of the State.\n",
              "It followed that any death of a serviceman on active service potentially engaged the responsibility of the State.\n",
              "All the evidence was likely to be under the control of the State.\n",
              "Where a soldier died on active service, whether he was a conscript, a regular or a reservist this triggered the obligation to hold an independent investigation.\n",
              "This was certainly the case where the circumstances of a soldiers death indicated the possibility of a systemic or operational failing by military personnel.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal considered a number of cases of deaths in the custody of the State, of one kind or another, where the article 2 procedural duty had been held to arise.\n",
              "It held at para 90: The question in the instant appeal is whether what may be called the custody principles apply to a case like this where the deceased lost his life while serving as a soldier in the Territorial Army.\n",
              "The Court went on to give an affirmative answer to this question, at least in the circumstances of a death from causes such as those that resulted in Private Smiths death.\n",
              "The obligation to hold an article 2 investigation is triggered by circumstances that give ground for suspicion that the State may have breached a substantive obligation imposed by article 2.\n",
              "That in its turn raises the question of the scope of the substantive obligations that a State owes in relation to its armed forces, which I have raised above.\n",
              "Whatever the scope of those obligations I do not consider that the death of a soldier on active service of itself raises a presumption that there has been a breach of those obligations.\n",
              "Troops on active service are at risk of being killed despite the exercise of due diligence by those responsible for doing their best to protect them.\n",
              "Death of a serviceman from illness no more raises an inference of breach of duty on the part of the State than the death of a civilian in hospital.\n",
              "For these reasons I reject the submission that the death of a serviceman on active service, assuming that this occurs within the article 1 jurisdiction of a State, automatically gives rise to an obligation to hold an article 2 investigation.\n",
              "Inquiries into the deaths of servicemen.\n",
              "I have already referred to the fact that, whatever the requirements of the Convention may be, the United Kingdom has a staged system of investigation into deaths.\n",
              "Where a death occurs in circumstances involving a public authority, an in house investigation will often precede the inquest and provide valuable information to assist the inquest.\n",
              "In the present case the Special Investigations Branch of the Military Police carried out an investigation into Private Smiths death and two Boards of Inquiry made reports.\n",
              "It was because the first of these was not disclosed to the coroner that a second inquest is to be held.\n",
              "I would expect that in the case of every military death in service some form of internal investigation is held.\n",
              "As the bodies of servicemen who die or are killed on active service abroad are brought back to this country, any internal investigation that has taken place will be followed by a public inquest that will satisfy many of the requirements of an article 2 investigation.\n",
              "It will often be only in the course of the inquest that it will become apparent that there is an issue as to whether there has been a breach by the State of its positive article 2 obligations.\n",
              "Only at that stage will it be appreciated that the exercise that is in progress is one called for by article 2 and one that must, if possible, satisfy the requirements of that article.\n",
              "Whether the inquest will be the appropriate medium to do this will depend on the nature of the obligation that is alleged to have been broken.\n",
              "The decision in Middleton, and section 5(2) of the 2009 Act that gives effect to it, requires the coroner to adapt the verdict, insofar as this is possible, in order to satisfy the requirements of article 2.\n",
              "Must the second inquest satisfy the procedural requirements of article 2?\n",
              "The Coroner ruled at the end of the first inquest that it was not necessary to satisfy the procedural requirements of article 2.\n",
              "Collins J and the Court of Appeal have held that the Coroner was mistaken.\n",
              "I agree.\n",
              "This is not, however, because Private Smiths death on active service, of itself, gave rise to a suspicion of breach by the State of its substantive article 2 obligations.\n",
              "It is because the evidence that was placed before the Coroner has raised the possibility that there was a failure in the system that should have been in place to protect soldiers from the risk posed by the extreme temperatures in which they had to serve.\n",
              "On the facts disclosed it was arguable that there was a breach of the States substantive obligations under article 2.\n",
              "This was enough to trigger the need to give a verdict that complied with the requirements of article 2.\n",
              "I am not convinced that the Coroners narrative verdict failed to do this.\n",
              "It summarised the facts leading to Private Smiths death and ended: Jason George Smiths death was caused by a serious failure to recognise and take appropriate steps to address the difficulty that he had in adjusting to the climate.\n",
              "The new inquest is likely to receive more detailed evidence of the circumstances surrounding Private Smiths death.\n",
              "In conducting that inquest the Coroner should certainly attempt to satisfy the requirements of an article 2 investigation.\n",
              "For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal on the second issue.\n",
              "LORD HOPE\n",
              "I agree with Lord Phillips that a member of the States armed forces is not, by reason of his or her personal status according to the military law and discipline of the United Kingdom, within the jurisdiction of the state for the purposes of article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n",
              "To hold otherwise would be to go beyond the categories that have hitherto been recognised by the Strasbourg Court in cases that do not arise from the effective control of territory within the Council of Europe area.\n",
              "But, as to the reasons for this view, I am in full and respectful agreement too with the judgment of Lord Collins.\n",
              "It is perhaps worth noting, in support of his conclusion that there are no policy grounds for extending the scope of the Convention to members of the armed services serving abroad simply because they are under the authority and control of the United Kingdom, that in an interview which he gave shortly after his retirement as President of the European Court of Human Rights, Luzius Wildhaber questioned how the Court could function effectively as a court when there was no prospect of it acquiring reliable evidence concerning the situation beyond the frontiers of Member States.\n",
              "He suggested that expecting the Court to act in such circumstances risked turning it into a campaigning organisation making allegations without solid evidence.\n",
              "He saw this as a compelling reason to be very careful about extending the notion of extra territoriality too far and to be wary about departing too much from the Bankovic judgment: Reflections of a Former President of the European Court of Human Rights [2010] EHRLR 169, 174.\n",
              "It is one thing, therefore, to recognise a Member States jurisdiction over persons within an area beyond the frontiers of the Member States over which their armed forces have established total and exclusive de facto control such as a military base, a military hospital or a detention centre, on the analogy with the extra territorial exception made for embassies: Al Saadoon and Mufdhi v United Kingdom (Application No 61498/08) (unreported) 30 June 2009, para 88.\n",
              "It is quite another to extend that jurisdiction to areas outside premises of that kind over which the armed forces may be operating but over which they do not have exclusive control, where the safeguarding of Convention rights cannot be guaranteed and where reliable evidence about the circumstances of alleged violations could be hard to come by because the state over whose territory these operations are being conducted is not a party to the Convention.\n",
              "A decision that the extra territorial jurisdiction should extend that far in this case would be likely to have profound consequences for other Member States and, it would seem from what Luzius Wildhaber has said, for the Court itself.\n",
              "A decision of that kind is best left to Strasbourg.\n",
              "I would in any event respectfully endorse the view expressed by Lord Brown of Eaton under Heywood in R (Al Skeini) v Secretary of State for Defence [2008] AC 153, para 107, for the further reasons he gives in this case, that article 1 should not be construed as reaching any further than the existing Strasbourg jurisprudence clearly shows it to reach.\n",
              "I also would hold that Private Smith was not within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom within the meaning of article 1 when he was outside his base while serving in Iraq.\n",
              "There is nothing that I would wish to add on the first issue.\n",
              "The second issue in this appeal is whether the fresh inquest into Private Smiths death would have to comply with the procedural investigatory obligation guaranteed by article 2 of the Convention.\n",
              "At first sight this question is academic because the Secretary of State agrees that he will not submit to the new coroner in the fresh inquest that the scope of the investigation, or the nature of the verdict, should be less broad than would be appropriate if the inquest must satisfy the obligation of the United Kingdom under that article: see the Court of Appeals judgment [2009] 3 WLR 1099, para 62.\n",
              "This is on the assumption that, as Private Smith died on base, he was within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom within the meaning of article 1 when he died and because the findings of the coroner at the first inquest indicate a possible breach of the positive obligation to establish processes to deal with the risk of heatstroke and hyperthermia.\n",
              "But, as Ms Rose QC for the respondent pointed out, a concession as to the scope of the inquest would not bind the coroner.\n",
              "The question whether the procedural obligation was triggered by Private Smiths death was argued before Collins J, in the Court of Appeal and before this Court on the basis that it raised an important issue of principle.\n",
              "Its importance is not limited to cases where members of the armed forces are serving in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan.\n",
              "It extends to cases where at the time of their death they were serving in the United Kingdom in Northern Ireland, for example or within the territory of another Council of Europe Member State.\n",
              "In the ideal world this would be an empty question.\n",
              "The coroner would have complete freedom to determine the scope of his own inquiry and to adapt the form and content of his verdict according to the needs of each case.\n",
              "That however is not how the scheme for the conduct of inquests has been designed in English law.\n",
              "As Lord Bingham of Cornhill explained in R (Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner [2004] 2 AC 182, paras 34 35, the scheme which has been enacted by and under the authority of Parliament must be respected, save to the extent that a change of interpretation is required to honour the international obligations of the United Kingdom under the Convention: see also R (Sacker) v West Yorkshire Coroner [2004] 1 WLR 796, para 27.\n",
              "The crucial difference is to be found in the way the word how in section 11(5)(b)(ii) of the Coroners Act 1988 and rule 36(1)(b) of the Coroners Rules 1984 is to be interpreted.\n",
              "Tempting though it may be to depart from Middleton by declaring that there is really no material difference between the functions of the coroner and the jury in the two types of inquest as Lord Phillips has indicated, I think for all the reasons that were given in that case we should not do so.\n",
              "The temptation to do this, adopting what the sheriff may do when he is making his determination according to the Scottish model, was confronted and resisted in Middleton, and I think that we must follow the decision that was taken in that case.\n",
              "On the other hand I would not wish to limit the scope that is available to the coroner under rule 43 of the Coroners Rules 1984.\n",
              "How far he may go in pursuing lines of inquiry in order to determine whether he should make a report under that rule with a view to preventing the recurrence of similar fatalities must depend on his judgment as to what is appropriate in the circumstances.\n",
              "It is only in cases where the article 2 procedural duty applies, therefore, that the Middleton approach is available to the coroner.\n",
              "It will then be necessary for him to conduct an inquiry which is effective, as that expression was explained by the Grand Chamber in Ramsahai v The Netherlands (2007) 46 EHRR 983, paras 324 325; see also R (L (A Patient)) v Secretary of State for Justice (Equality and Human Rights Commission intervening) [2009] AC 588, para 78, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry.\n",
              "But that approach is not available in all cases.\n",
              "It arises only in the comparatively few cases where the states responsibility for the death is or may be engaged: R (Hurst) v London Northern District Coroner [2007] 2 AC 189, para 48 Lord Brown of Eaton under Heywood.\n",
              "In all other cases the proceedings must be conducted according to the regime for conducting inquests in England and Wales as summarised in R v Coroner for North Humberside and Scunthorpe, Ex p Jamieson [1995] QB 1.\n",
              "Section 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 has retained the distinction between these two forms of inquest.\n",
              "It is only where necessary to avoid a breach of any of the Convention rights that it permits the Middleton approach: see section 5(2).\n",
              "The scheme which Parliament has enacted in section 5 of the 2009 Act is deceptively simple.\n",
              "In practice however it gives rise to a variety of problems to which the Courts attention was drawn by counsel.\n",
              "We cannot resolve them all in this case.\n",
              "But at the root of most, if not all, of them lies the problem of determining whether the case in hand is one which attracts the procedural obligation that is imposed by article 2.\n",
              "In broad terms, it is triggered by any death occurring in circumstances in which it appears that any one or more of the substantive obligations that article 2 imposes not to take life without justification, and to establish a framework of laws, precautions, procedures and means of enforcement which will to the greatest extent practicable protect life, has been, or may have been, violated in circumstances in which it appears that agents of the state are, or may be, in some way implicated: R (Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner [2004] 2 AC 182, paras 2 and 3.\n",
              "The procedural obligation depends on the existence of the substantive right.\n",
              "It cannot exist independently: R (Gentle) v Prime Minister [2008] AC 1356, para 6.\n",
              "Some situations in which the procedural obligation is triggered are now well recognised.\n",
              "The suicide of an individual while in the custody of the state is the prime example.\n",
              "It has been extended to the case where a prisoner attempted to commit suicide while in custody and suffered brain damage: R (L (A Patient)) v Secretary of State for Justice (Equality and Human Rights Commission intervening) [2009] AC 588.\n",
              "This is because it has been recognised that prisoners as a class present a particular risk of suicide and because those who have custody of them, as agents of the state, are or may be in some way implicated.\n",
              "A Middleton inquest is required in all these cases, because it is at least possible that the prison authorities failed to take the steps to protect the prisoners life that the substantive right requires.\n",
              "As Lord Rodger of Earlsferry said in Ls case, para 59, suicide is in this respect like any other violent death in custody.\n",
              "The procedural obligation extends to prisoners as a class irrespective of the particular circumstances in which the death occurred.\n",
              "The fact that they are under the care and control of the authorities by whom they are held gives rise to an automatic obligation to investigate the circumstances.\n",
              "The same is true of suicides committed by others subject to compulsory detention by a public authority, such as patients suffering from mental illness who have been detained under the Mental Health Acts: Savage v South Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (MIND intervening) [2009] AC 681.\n",
              "This approach has the merit of clarity.\n",
              "Everyone knows from the outset that the inquest in these cases must follow the guidance that was given in Middleton, paras 36 38.\n",
              "The issue before the Court is whether it is possible to achieve equal clarity in the case of an inquest into the death of a soldier.\n",
              "Soldiers who die while in military custody are, of course, in the same position as any other prisoner.\n",
              "Their case has the benefit of the substantive obligation, so the procedural obligation applies.\n",
              "So too does the case of members of the other armed services who die in such circumstances.\n",
              "The question is how far, if at all, the detainees approach can be applied to other situations which servicemen and servicewomen encounter in the service of their country, at home or abroad.\n",
              "Death may occur from natural causes as well as a result of neglect or injury.\n",
              "And fatal injuries may occur due to the mishandling of equipment during training or in other situations when personnel are not engaged in combat as well as in the face of the enemy.\n",
              "The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have brought the issue into greater prominence.\n",
              "But the situation that we face today is in principle no different from that which members of the armed forces serving both at home and abroad have faced for many years.\n",
              "The single characteristic which currently unites all our service personnel is that they have volunteered for the branch of the service to which they belong.\n",
              "This applies to those who have made their profession in the armed services as well as those, like Private Smith, who chose to serve part time in reserve forces such as the Territorial Army.\n",
              "Mandatory military service no longer exists in this country.\n",
              "For this reason I would be reluctant to follow the guidance of the Strasbourg Court that is to be found in cases such as Chember v Russia, (Application No 7188/03) (unreported) 3 July 2008.\n",
              "The applicant in that case was called up for two years mandatory military service in the course of which he was subjected to ill treatment and harassment.\n",
              "The court was careful to stress in para 49 that many acts that would constitute degrading or inhuman treatment in respect of prisoners may not reach the threshold of ill treatment when they occur in the armed forces, provided they contribute to the specific mission of the armed forces in which they form part, for example training for battle field conditions: Engel v The Netherlands (No 1) (1976) 1 EHRR 647.\n",
              "But the description which it gave in para 50 of the duty that the State owes to persons performing military service was directed specifically to cases where it decides to call up ordinary citizens to perform military service.\n",
              "That description cannot be applied to those who serve in the armed forces as volunteers.\n",
              "It is true, of course, that those who join the armed services as volunteers accept the obligation to comply with military discipline.\n",
              "They are trained to obey orders, and they are subject to sanctions if they do not do so.\n",
              "Private Smith did not choose to go to Iraq.\n",
              "He received a notice of compulsory call up.\n",
              "But it was a condition of the service for which he volunteered that he would obey instructions of this kind.\n",
              "I do not think that his situation can be distinguished from that of any other member of the armed services who is deployed on active service.\n",
              "There is a close analogy with men and women who volunteer for service in the emergency services.\n",
              "Fire fighters, in particular, may face situations of great danger where their lives are at risk.\n",
              "But they follow instructions because that is a necessary part of the job they have chosen to do.\n",
              "It is tempting to select examples of cases where the cause of a soldiers death may be attributed to failures on the part of the State and to conclude that this fact in itself gives rise to the need for a Middleton inquest.\n",
              "But I would resist this temptation.\n",
              "The examples that Lord Rodger gives illustrate the difficulty.\n",
              "He says that he would apply the reasoning as to a prisoner committing suicide to a raw recruit to the armed forces who committed suicide during initial military training in barracks in this country: para 118.\n",
              "We have no evidence that raw recruits to the armed services are in this respect especially vulnerable, but this reference calls to mind the tragic cases of the four young soldiers who died at Deep Cut Barracks between 1995 and 2002 which according to the Ministry of Defence were all cases of suicide.\n",
              "Those soldiers were still in training, but they were not raw recruits.\n",
              "The training they were undergoing at Deep Cut was a course of further training, additional to the initial training which they had received in an Army Training Regiment.\n",
              "Where does one draw the line between the raw recruit and the more seasoned soldier who is still in training? And what about schoolchildren who commit suicide as a result of bullying from which, as they must attend school, there is no escape? Or students who do so because of the pressures they encounter in colleges or universities? To extend the substantive article 2 obligation to volunteers while they are undergoing basic or advanced training would go further than has so far been indicated as necessary by Strasbourg.\n",
              "Then there is the example that Lord Rodger gives of deaths as a result of friendly fire from other British forces: para 126.\n",
              "Trooper David Clarke, the son of the second claimant in R (Gentle) v Prime Minister [2008] AC 1356, was killed by friendly fire while on armed service with the Queens Royal Lancers in Iraq.\n",
              "He was driving a Challenger 2 tank when it was fired on by another Challenger 2 tank from a different unit whose crew had mistaken it for an enemy vehicle.\n",
              "That was an example of friendly fire by British forces.\n",
              "But a number of other servicemen, including several soldiers serving with the Queens Own Highlanders, were killed during the same campaign when their armoured vehicle was fired on by a US Black Hawk Helicopter.\n",
              "Are cases of accidental deaths due to friendly fire by allied forces to be distinguished from those which are due to accidents caused by British forces? And why should deaths due to friendly fire be distinguished from deaths due to injuries sustained as a result of the actions of opposing forces that could also have been avoided if mistakes had not been made by the soldiers themselves or by their commanders? The risk of death due to friendly fire in the confusion and heat of battle is one of the risks that a soldier must face as part of the mission for which he has volunteered.\n",
              "The same is true of the risk of death while in training due, for example, to mistakes made while handling weapons or other equipment or to exposure to the elements.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal applied the principle that extends the protection of article 2 to detained mental patients to the case of soldiers such as Private Smith who die of heatstroke while on active service in Iraq: [2009] 3 WLR 1099, paras 104 105.\n",
              "The essence of its reasoning is to be found in these sentences taken from para 105: [The soldiers] are under the control of and subject to army discipline.\n",
              "They must do what the army requires them to do.\n",
              "If the army sends them out into the desert they must go.\n",
              "In this respect they are in the same position as a conscript.\n",
              "Once they have signed up for a particular period they can no more disobey an order than a conscript can.\n",
              "On this basis it saw no reason why they should not have the same protection as is afforded by article 2 to a conscript.\n",
              "I think that this reasoning goes further than the Strasbourg Court has gone in the case of conscripts, as its reference in Chember v Russia (Application No 7188/03) 3 July 2008, para 49, to risks inherent in the specific mission of the armed forces shows.\n",
              "But it seems to me to be objectionable on other grounds.\n",
              "Members of our armed services are not conscripts.\n",
              "They have chosen to accept the demands of military discipline.\n",
              "Moreover, if the fact that they must obey orders is to be treated as the criterion, there is no logical stopping place.\n",
              "Every situation where death occurs in circumstances where they were obeying orders, from the training ground to battle conditions, would have to be treated in the same way.\n",
              "I would reject the analogy with those who are in the custody of the state.\n",
              "The volunteer soldiers duty to obey orders is not comparable with the state of the detainee who is held against his will in the States custody.\n",
              "In my opinion the substantive obligation under article 2 does not extend automatically to all service personnel in a volunteer army while they are on active service at home or within the article 1 jurisdiction overseas.\n",
              "Like Lord Mance, I regard the proposition that all deaths of military personnel on active service require to be investigated by a Middleton type inquiry as going too far: para 214.\n",
              "As I said in R (Gentle) v Prime Minister [2008] AC 1356, para 19, the guarantee in the first sentence of article 2(1) is not violated simply by deploying servicemen and women on active service overseas as part of an organised military force which is properly equipped and capable of defending itself, even though the risk of their being killed is inherent in what they are being asked to do.\n",
              "But one must not overlook the fact that there have been many cases where the death of service personnel indicates a systemic or operational failing on the part of the State.\n",
              "These may range from a failure to provide them with the equipment which is needed to protect life to mistakes made in the way they were deployed due to bad planning or inadequate appreciation of the risks that had to be faced.\n",
              "These are cases where the investigator should, as article 2 requires, take all reasonable steps to secure the evidence relating to the incident, to find out, if possible, what caused the death, and to identify the defects in the system which brought it about and any other factors that may be relevant: see R (Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner [2004] 2 AC 182, para 36.\n",
              "Private Smiths death, which occurred on base, seems to me to fall into this category.\n",
              "This was a place over which the armed forces had exclusive control, so the jurisdictional requirement was satisfied.\n",
              "And all the signs are that this was a death which might have been prevented if proper precautions had been taken.\n",
              "There is a sufficient indication of a systemic breach in an area that was within its jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1 to engage the responsibility of the State to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances.\n",
              "There is something that ought to be inquired into, if only to ensure that tragedies of this or a similar kind do not happen again.\n",
              "I would hold that this is enough to trigger the article 2 procedural obligation so as to require the coroner to conduct a Middleton inquiry in his case.\n",
              "I recognise that the case by case approach which I favour, coupled with the lack of definition in this area of the law, creates a very real problem for the parties as well as for coroners.\n",
              "It risks creating satellite litigation as decisions as to whether a case falls on one side of the boundary are opened up for challenge, resulting in delays and increased costs.\n",
              "The solution to this highly unsatisfactory situation lies in a reform of the law which restricts inquiries in England and Wales which are of that kind to cases where there are grounds for thinking that the substantive obligation under article 2 has been violated.\n",
              "It does not lie in extending the potential reach of article 2 to a broadly defined category of cases which may well deserve sympathy but which lie outside the well defined circumstances in which the positive obligation has hitherto been held to apply.\n",
              "The balance of advantage until the law is reformed lies, I would suggest, in holding the line at cases where there are grounds for thinking that there was a failure by the State in fulfilling its responsibility to protect life and not extending it to cases which, although involving the element of compulsion that is inherent in service life, are truly outside that category.\n",
              "I would allow the appeal against the Court of Appeals order on the first issue.\n",
              "I would dismiss the appeal on the second issue.\n",
              "LORD RODGER\n",
              "The present appeal arises out of the death of Private Jason Smith on 13 August 2003, while serving in Iraq.\n",
              "He died of heat stroke.\n",
              "On the day in question the effects were first noticed when Private Smith was seen lying on the floor in the Stadium at Al Amarah where his accommodation was.\n",
              "He was taken to the medical facility at Camp Abu Naji where he died shortly afterwards.\n",
              "Because he died at the Camp, which was the centre of British operations in the area, the Secretary of State concedes that he died within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for purposes of article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (the Convention).\n",
              "The Secretary of State further concedes that the circumstances of his death are such as to call for an independent inquiry under article 2 of the Convention.\n",
              "Despite these concessions, the Secretary of State asks this Court to decide points relating to the United Kingdoms jurisdiction for purposes of article 1 and to the circumstances in which an inquest which complies with the requirements in R (Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner [2004] 2 AC 182 (a Middleton inquest) has to be held.\n",
              "The precise basis and extent of the Secretary of States concession on the first point are not altogether clear to me.\n",
              "So far as the second point is concerned, the parties appeared to agree that coroners and lawyers found it difficult to know whether, in a case involving the death of a soldier on active service overseas, any inquest should be a Middleton inquest, or whether it should start a Jamieson inquest (one whose more limited scope is described in R v Coroner for North Humberside and Scunthorpe, Ex p Jamieson [1995] QB 1), but evolve into a Middleton inquest if the coroners investigation seemed to require it.\n",
              "For the reasons given by Lord Collins, to which I could not possibly add anything of value, I would allow the appeal on the first issue.\n",
              "It follows that, leaving aside the position when they are on a United Kingdom base, soldiers on active service overseas are not within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for purposes of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "It follows also that their deaths will not give rise to any requirement to carry out an article 2 investigation.\n",
              "Nevertheless, the Secretary of State asks for a decision on the point.\n",
              "As counsel for the respondent pointed out, an issue could certainly arise in relation to a soldier who had been killed in combat in this country Northern Ireland providing recent examples.\n",
              "Unfortunately, counsels submissions left me, at least, unclear about how exactly a decision one way or the other, as to the form of the inquest, would affect such practical matters as how the coroner or parties prepared for the inquest or what would happen if the coroner decided, half way through, that it should become a Middleton inquest.\n",
              "There is, therefore, a limit to the guidance that this Court can usefully give in a case where the point is moot and in which we have not been told of any particular practical problems that have arisen.\n",
              "Ms Rose QC and Mr Beloff QC submitted, however, that the Court should lay down and it would have to be a matter of law that all inquests into the death of a soldier on active service should be Middleton inquests.\n",
              "Then everyone would know where they stood and such matters as legal aid, representation of relatives and the form of any eventual verdict would be clear from the outset.\n",
              "The submission is superficially attractive and, doubtless for that reason, a somewhat similar argument has been tried before.\n",
              "In R (Hurst) v London Northern District Coroner [2007] 2 AC 189, 214, Lord Brown of Eaton under Heywood dealt with it in this way: Middleton clearly accepted that Jamieson was correctly decided.\n",
              "Were it otherwise, the House could simply have overruled it without recourse to the Human Rights Act 1998 at all, let alone section 3.\n",
              "It is plain that the House was not intending the Middleton approach thereafter to apply in all cases.\n",
              "In the first place, an article 2 investigative obligation only arises in the comparatively few cases where the states responsibility is or may be engaged.\n",
              "Secondly, even where the obligation does arise, it will often be satisfied without resort to a Middleton inquestin some cases by criminal proceedings, in particular where a defendant pleads not guilty and the trial involves a full exploration of the facts surrounding the death (para 30 of the committees opinion delivered by Lord Bingham of Cornhill); in others, like McCann, where short verdicts in the traditional form will enable the jury to express their conclusion on the central issue canvassed at the inquest at para 31 of the opinion.\n",
              "All this is clear from the committee's opinion which in terms recognises at para 36 that only sometimes will a change of approach be called for.\n",
              "The key point is that the decision in Middleton involved using section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 to place an extended construction on section 11(5)(b)(ii) of the Coroners Act 1988 and rule 36 of the Coroners Rules 1984 (SI 1984/552).\n",
              "This was justified only because the extended construction was necessary in order to meet the requirements of article 2.\n",
              "So counsels submission really implied that, as a class, the deaths of British soldiers on active service in, say, Iraq or Afghanistan, would trigger the article 2 investigative obligation.\n",
              "I would reject that approach.\n",
              "In R (L(A Patient)) v Secretary of State for Justice [2009] AC 588 a young man had tried to hang himself in Feltham Young Offender Institution.\n",
              "The Secretary of State argued that, since the obligation on the prison authorities to protect a prisoner from himself is not absolute and so only arises in particular circumstances, a suicide can occur without there having been any breach of the authorities article 2 obligation to protect him.\n",
              "So there did not need to be an independent investigation unless there was some positive reason to believe that the authorities had indeed been in breach of their obligation to protect the prisoner.\n",
              "I rejected that argument in these words, at p 619: 59.\n",
              "That argument is mistaken.\n",
              "Whenever a prisoner kills himself, it is at least possible that the prison authorities, who are responsible for the prisoner, have failed, either in their obligation to take general measures to diminish the opportunities for prisoners to harm themselves, or in their operational obligation to try to prevent the particular prisoner from committing suicide.\n",
              "Given the closed nature of the prison world, without an independent investigation you might never know.\n",
              "So there must be an investigation of that kind to find out whether something did indeed go wrong.\n",
              "In this respect a suicide is like any other violent death in custody.\n",
              "In affirming the need for an effective form of investigation in a case involving the suicide of a man in police custody, the European court held that such an investigation should be held when a resort to force has resulted in a persons death: Akdogdu v Turkey, para 52. 60.\n",
              "In R (Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner [2004] 2 AC 182, another case of a suicide in custody, at p 191, para 3, Lord Bingham of Cornhill summarised the jurisprudence of the European court as imposing an obligation to hold an independent investigation if it appears that one or other of the substantive obligations has been, or may have been, violated and it appears that agents of the state are, or may be, in some way, implicated.\n",
              "Mr Giffin suggested that Lord Binghams formulation was inconsistent with there being a requirement for an independent investigation in all cases of suicide in custody.\n",
              "I do not agree.\n",
              "In summarising the case law, Lord Bingham was recognising that, where the circumstances of a prisoners death in custody indicate that the substantive obligations of the state may have been violated, any violation, whether due to a systemic or operational failure, will necessarily have involved members of the prison service in one capacity or another.\n",
              "An independent investigation is therefore required to see whether there was, in fact, a violation.\n",
              "The starting point for the reasoning in this passage is that the prison authorities are under both an obligation to take general measures to diminish the opportunities for prisoners to harm themselves and an operational obligation, in certain limited circumstances, to try to prevent a particular prisoner from committing suicide.\n",
              "The authorities are under these obligations because persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them: Edwards v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 487, 507, para 56.\n",
              "Therefore the mere fact that a prisoner has committed suicide indicates that there may have been a failure on the part of the prison authorities to perform their article 2 obligations to prevent those in custody from doing so.\n",
              "I would apply precisely the same reasoning if, say, a raw recruit to the armed forces committed suicide during initial military training.\n",
              "It is obvious and past experience shows that recruits, who are usually very young and away from their families and friends for the first time, may be unable to cope with the stresses of military discipline and training.\n",
              "In these circumstances I would regard such recruits as vulnerable individuals for whom the military authorities have undertaken responsibility.\n",
              "So the authorities must have staff trained, and structures in place, to deal with the potential problems which may, quite predictably, arise.\n",
              "Therefore, if a suicide occurred in such circumstances, this would suggest that there might have been a failure on the part of the authorities to discharge their obligation to protect the recruits.\n",
              "There would need to be an independent inquiry especially since recruits are trained in a closed environment.\n",
              "I would take much the same view of Private Smiths death in this case.\n",
              "It may well be that, in the circumstances in Iraq at the time, a soldier could die of heatstroke without there having been any violation of the Armys obligations under article 2.\n",
              "Nevertheless, the likelihood of extreme heat and its possible effects on soldiers were known to the military authorities.\n",
              "There was an obvious need to take appropriate precautions.\n",
              "So, where, as here, a soldier suffers so badly from heatstroke, while in his living accommodation, that he dies shortly afterwards, it is at least possible that the Army authorities failed in some aspect of their article 2 obligation to protect him.\n",
              "For that reason I am satisfied that, given his concession on jurisdiction, the Secretary of State was correct to concede the need for a Middleton inquest into Private Smiths death.\n",
              "I would, however, take an entirely different view of the death of a trained soldier in action e g, when a roadside bomb blows up the vehicle in which he is patrolling, or when his observation post is destroyed by a mortar bomb.\n",
              "The fact that the soldier was killed in these circumstances raises no prima facie case for saying that the United Kingdom army authorities have failed in their obligation to protect him and that there has, in consequence, been a breach of his article 2 Convention rights.\n",
              "In the first place, even if an active service unit is, in some ways a closed world, it would be quite wrong to construct any argument around the idea that ordinary members of the forces are vulnerable in the same way as prisoners or detained patients or, even, conscripts doing military national service in Russia or Turkey.\n",
              "I have already accepted that, in the initial stages of their training, recruits to the United Kingdom forces may indeed be vulnerable in this sense.\n",
              "But those who pass through training and are accepted into the forces are often the reverse of vulnerable: their training and discipline make them far more self reliant and resilient than most members of the population and, so far from being isolated, they form part of a group whose members are supportive of one another.\n",
              "Even more importantly, any suggestion that the death of a soldier in combat conditions points to some breach by the United Kingdom of his article 2 right to life is not only to mistake, but much worse to devalue, what our soldiers do.\n",
              "It is not just that their job involves being exposed to the risk of death or injury.\n",
              "That is true of many jobs, from steeplejacks to firemen, from test pilots to divers.\n",
              "Uniquely, the job of members of the armed forces involves them being deployed in situations where, as they well know, opposing forces will actually be making a determined effort, and using all their resources, to kill or injure them.\n",
              "While steps can be taken, by training and by providing suitable armour, to give our troops some measure of protection against these hostile attacks, that protection can never be complete.\n",
              "Deaths and injuries are inevitable.\n",
              "Indeed it is precisely because, in combat, our troops are inevitably exposed to these great dangers that they deserve and enjoy the admiration of the community.\n",
              "The long established exemption from inheritance tax of the estates of those who die on active service is an acknowledgment of the fact that members of the armed forces can be called upon to risk death in this way in the defence of what the government perceives to be the national interest.\n",
              "I have deliberately referred to our soldiers and our troops because it may well be that not all Council of Europe countries look on their armed forces in the same way.\n",
              "For historical or cultural reasons, some may be reluctant to see their armed forces engage in combat or carry out dangerous peace keeping operations.\n",
              "So they may have a very different attitude to the risks to which their forces should be exposed.\n",
              "Correspondingly, members of their forces may not attract the level of public esteem that members of our forces, who are regularly expected to face very real threats of death or injury, enjoy.\n",
              "At present our troops are exposed to great dangers in Afghanistan.\n",
              "Inevitably, many have been killed and many more have been wounded.\n",
              "To suggest that these deaths and injuries can always, or even usually, be seen as the result of some failure to protect the soldiers, whether by their immediate companions or by more senior officers or generals or ministers, is to depreciate the bravery of the men and women who face these dangers.\n",
              "They are brave precisely because they do the job, knowing full well that, however much is done to protect them, they are going to be up against opposing forces who are intent on killing or injuring them and who are sometimes going to succeed.\n",
              "This is the background to any inquest into the death of a soldier on active service.\n",
              "In most cases the starting point is that the soldier died as a result of a deliberate attack by opposing forces by, say, a mortar bomb, or a roadside bomb, or by sniper fire.\n",
              "Usually, at least, that will also be the end point of the coroners investigation because it will be an adequate description not only of how the soldier was killed, but also of the circumstances in which he was killed.\n",
              "Of course, it will often perhaps even usually be possible to say that the death might well not have occurred if the soldier had not been ordered to carry out the particular patrol, or if he had been in a vehicle with thicker armour plating, or if the observation post had been better protected.\n",
              "But, even if that is correct, by itself, it does not point to any failure by the relevant authorities to do their best to protect the soldiers lives.\n",
              "It would only do so if contrary to the very essence of active military service the authorities could normally be expected to ensure that our troops would not be killed or injured by opposing forces.\n",
              "On the contrary, in order to achieve a legitimate peacekeeping objective, a commander may have to order his men to carry out an operation when he knows that they are exhausted or that their equipment is not in the best condition.\n",
              "Indeed the European Convention on Human Rights owes its very existence to countless individuals who carried out operations in just such circumstances.\n",
              "For these reasons, I am satisfied that, where a serviceman or woman has been killed by opposing forces in the course of military operations, the coroner will usually have no basis for considering, at the outset, that there has been a violation of any substantive obligation under article 2.\n",
              "So a Middleton inquest will not be called for and indeed it would not be lawful, in such circumstances, to return the wider verdict which is required where a potential violation of article 2 is under consideration.\n",
              "Of course, as his investigation proceeds, the coroner may uncover new information which does point to a possible violation of article 2.\n",
              "To take an extreme example, it may emerge from the evidence that the soldier actually died as a result of friendly fire from other British forces.\n",
              "At that point, the legal position will change because there will be reason to believe that the military authorities may indeed have failed in their article 2 duty to protect the soldiers life.\n",
              "So the coroner will conduct the inquest in the manner required to fulfil the United Kingdoms investigatory obligation under article 2.\n",
              "But the coroner is not concerned with broad political decisions which may seem to have a bearing, and may indeed actually have a bearing, on what happened.\n",
              "This is clear from Nachova v Bulgaria (2005) 42 EHRR 933, 957, para 110, where the Grand Chamber described the essential purpose of an article 2 investigation as being to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility.\n",
              "Once it is established, say, that a soldier died because the blast from a roadside bomb penetrated the armour plating on his vehicle, it may well be inferred that he would not have died if the plating had been stronger.\n",
              "And that simple fact may be worth pointing out as a possible guide for the future.\n",
              "But questions, say, as to whether it would have been feasible to fit stronger protection, or as to why the particular vehicles were used in the operation or campaign, or as to why those vehicles, as opposed to vehicles with stronger protection, were originally purchased by the Ministry of Defence, or as to whether it would have been better to have more helicopters available etc, all raise issues which are essentially political rather than legal.\n",
              "That being so, a curious aspect of counsels submissions before this Court was the complete absence of any reference to Parliament as the forum in which such matters should be raised and debated and in which ministers should be held responsible.\n",
              "Of course, in consequence of pressure brought to bear by Parliament, the government might set up an independent inquiry with wide terms of reference to look into all aspects of a situation, including the political aspects.\n",
              "But we are concerned with the scope of a coroners inquest whose function is different.\n",
              "Many of the issues about the deaths of soldiers which are, understandably, of the greatest concern to their relatives are indeed of this much broader nature.\n",
              "In short, they raise questions of policy, not of legality, and so would fall outside the scope of any article 2 investigation which a coroner might be obliged to carry out.\n",
              "For these reasons I agree that the contentions advanced by Ms Rose and Mr Beloff should be rejected.\n",
              "LORD WALKER\n",
              "In common with other members of this Court I feel some disquiet about our engaging in protracted deliberation and the preparation of lengthy judgments on two issues which (as all parties agree) do not actually affect what is to happen in consequence of the tragic death of Pte Smith.\n",
              "It is not the function of this Court to deliver advisory opinions, and in this case we may be going some way beyond what would be regarded as a proper exercise of judicial power in a country with a written constitution providing for the separation of powers (for instance the position in Australia is very fully discussed in a paper A Human Rights Act, the Courts and the Constitution presented to the Australian Human Rights Commission by the Hon Michael McHugh AC on 5 March 2009).\n",
              "The fact that every death of a soldier in Afghanistan brings tragedy to his or her family, and sorrow to the whole nation, may not be a sufficient reason for stretching our jurisdiction to the limits.\n",
              "That is underlined by the second issue, as to coroners inquests, which has led to the submission of further detailed evidence which, informative as it is, has no possible bearing on the second inquest which is to be held on the death of Pte Smith.\n",
              "On the two issues argued before the Court I respectfully agree with Lord Collins on the first issue, and with Lord Phillips and Lord Rodger on the second issue.\n",
              "I would particularly associate myself with paras 118 127 of Lord Rodgers judgment.\n",
              "LADY HALE\n",
              "Mrs Smith must wonder why she is in this court.\n",
              "She did not ask to be here.\n",
              "All she wants is a proper inquiry, in which she can play a proper part, into how it was that her son Jason came to die of heatstroke while serving with the British army in Iraq.\n",
              "She wants to understand what happened to him, but she also wants others to understand it too, so that anything which reasonably can be done will be done to prevent other families suffering as hers has suffered.\n",
              "She had to begin these proceedings because of shortcomings in the first inquest, which are now conceded both by the Coroner and by the Ministry of Defence.\n",
              "The Ministry failed to produce the principal board of inquiry report into Private Smiths death, insisted upon wholesale redaction of the documents which were disclosed, and the coroner wrongly held that he had no power to order disclosure if the Ministry would not agree.\n",
              "As the judge commented, it has seemed to the family that the Army was concerned to cover up any shortcomings and to protect its reputation.\n",
              "That may not be a correct conclusion, but it is not surprising that it has been reached (para 5).\n",
              "But all that is now behind her.\n",
              "A new inquest is to be held and those points are conceded.\n",
              "More than that, Mrs Smith wished to establish that her son had died within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, so that he and she were covered by the guarantees in article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n",
              "This imposes upon the state a duty, not only to avoid taking life, but also to take positive steps to protect the right to life in a variety of ways.\n",
              "One of these is to hold a proper inquiry, in which the family of the deceased may play a proper part, if it appears that the state may have failed in its responsibility to protect life.\n",
              "But both of these points have also been conceded.\n",
              "The Ministry of Defence accept that Private Smith was within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom when he died.\n",
              "They will also not object to an inquest which examines, not only the precise cause of his death, but also the circumstances in which it took place.\n",
              "This is as far as they or anyone else can go, because it will be for the coroner to decide, on the basis of that inquiry, what sort of verdict should be delivered.\n",
              "But if the evidence were to warrant it, the verdict could clearly be one which identified any breach that there may have been of the United Kingdoms obligations under article 2.\n",
              "That is all that is needed to decide this case.\n",
              "The Ministry of Defence have appealed to this court because both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal accepted the invitation of both parties to decide more than they needed to decide.\n",
              "Of course they meant to be helpful.\n",
              "But because the Ministry of Defence did not like what they said, Mrs Smith has had to wait for more than two years for the case to be over so that the fresh inquest can be arranged.\n",
              "Perhaps worse, it is not at all clear what this court is doing.\n",
              "The trial judge ordered that the first inquisition and verdict be quashed and a new inquest held that complies with the procedural obligations implicit in Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as set out in the Courts judgment. (He also dismissed a competing claim by the Ministry of Defence but there was no appeal against that.) The Court of Appeal dismissed the Ministrys appeal.\n",
              "So the judges order stands.\n",
              "As I understand it, the most we might be asked to do is to delete the words as set out in the Courts judgment.\n",
              "He made no declarations as to the rights of the parties so we are not asked to change those.\n",
              "So we are merely making observations on two extremely important and interesting questions but we are not deciding anything.\n",
              "In those circumstances I doubt whether any of the important and interesting things which are said about those questions in this court can be part of the essential grounds for our decision and thus binding upon other courts in future.\n",
              "In the words of Sir Frederick Pollock, cited by Lord Denning in Close v Steel Company of Wales Ltd [1962] AC 367, at 388 389: Judicial authority belongs not to the exact words used in this or that judgment, nor even to all the reasons given, but only to the principles accepted and applied as necessary grounds of the decision.\n",
              "Lest it be thought that Lord Denning took an unusual view of the circumstances in which he was bound by previous authority, he also referred to Lord Selborne LC, in Caledonian Railway Company v Walkers Trustees (1882) 7 App Cas 259, at 275: A judgment which is right, and consistent with sound principles, upon the facts and circumstances of the case which the House had to decide, need not be construed as laying down a rule for a substantially different state of facts and circumstances, though some propositions, wider than the case itself required, may appear to have received countenance from those who then advised the House.\n",
              "Pithier still was the Earl of Halsbury LC in Quinn v Leathem [1901] AC 495, at 506: . a case is only an authority for what it actually decides.\n",
              "Technically, therefore, I believe that our views are not binding, but they are of course persuasive.\n",
              "So it is only polite to the powerful arguments advanced by counsel, and to the patience with which Mrs Smith has listened to them, to indicate where I currently stand on each of the two broader issues.\n",
              "On the jurisdiction issue, I remain of the view to which I was inclined in R (Gentle) v Prime Minister [2008] UKHL 20, [2008] AC 1356, that British soldiers serving in Iraq were within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom when they were killed, in one case by friendly fire and in the other by a road side bomb.\n",
              "I am quite clear that this was not part of the principle, or essential ground, upon which the House of Lords decided the case: this was that taking care to discover whether or not the war was legal in international law had nothing to do with the duty in article 2 to protect life.\n",
              "This can easily be tested.\n",
              "It would have made no difference to the decision on the issue in the case where the soldiers deaths had taken place: whether they were clearly within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom or whether they were not.\n",
              "The House did hear some argument on the point, but nothing as full as the argument which this court has heard.\n",
              "Although I am sorry to disagree with colleagues whose opinions are worthy of the deepest respect, I agree with the opinions of Lord Mance and Lord Kerr, and for the very full reasons which they give, and there is nothing which I can usefully add.\n",
              "On the second issue, I agree that this is a question for a coroner to determine on the evidence that emerges at the inquest, but I also agree with Lord Phillips and Lord Rodger that we already know enough to raise the serious possibility that the United Kingdom may in some way have been in breach of its obligations under article 2.\n",
              "So the scope of the inquiry must be wide enough to look into this and, depending on the conclusions drawn from the evidence, the verdict must be able to reflect this.\n",
              "I do not believe that we are either allowing or dismissing an appeal on either issue, but if we are I would dismiss it on both.\n",
              "LORD BROWN\n",
              "Are our armed services abroad, in Iraq, Afghanistan or wherever else they may be called upon to fight, within the United Kingdoms jurisdiction within the meaning of article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights? That is the critical first issue for decision on this appeal.\n",
              "If they are, then the United Kingdom is required to secure to them all the Convention rights and freedoms.\n",
              "Some will say that this is no less than they deserve.\n",
              "They are brave men and women, undoubtedly entitled to these rights and freedoms whilst serving (sometimes, as recently in Northern Ireland, on active service) at home.\n",
              "Why should they not enjoy the same rights when, whether they like it or not, they are called upon to face dangers abroad? When abroad, they are, after all, still subject to UK military law and, indeed, remain generally under the legislative, judicial and executive authority of the UK.\n",
              "Others, however, will say that to accord Convention rights and freedoms to our services whilst engaged in armed combat with hostile forces abroad makes no sense at all.\n",
              "It could serve only to inhibit decision making in the field and to compromise our services fighting power.\n",
              "For my part I can readily see the force of both arguments and do not pretend to have found this an easy case to decide.\n",
              "In the end, however, I have concluded that, save in an exceptional case like that of Private Smith himself whose death resulted from his treatment on base, Convention rights do not generally attach to our armed forces serving abroad.\n",
              "Having regard to the number and length of other judgments in the case, my own reasoning will be brief.\n",
              "Sometimes less is more.\n",
              "I take as my starting point the decision of the House of Lords in R (Al Skeini) v Secretary of State for Defence [2008] AC 153 where I sought to analyse the existing Strasbourg jurisprudence on the reach of article 1.\n",
              "Nothing that I have since heard or read has persuaded me that that analysis is wrong.\n",
              "It was known, of course, at the time this case was argued before us, that the application in Al Skeini was to be heard in Strasbourg on 9 June 2010, with the judgment of the Grand Chamber expected some 3 6 months later, and, obviously, if the application succeeds, it is likely to transform our understanding of the scope of article 1 in cases of this sort.\n",
              "Meanwhile, however, Al Skeini must be assumed to be correct and, in turn, the decision of the Grand Chamber in Bankovic v Belgium (2001) 11 EHRC 435 must be regarded as Strasbourgs ruling judgment on the point.\n",
              "There has been some suggestion (see, for example, paras 29 and 30 of Lord Phillips judgment) that, since Bankovic, a wider concept of article 1 jurisdiction based upon state agent authority has been gaining ground in Strasbourg.\n",
              "In Al Skeini (at paras 124 131) I dealt at length with one post Bankovic Strasbourg decision said to support such an approach Issa v Turkey (Merits) (2004) 41 EHRR 567 and concluded that it should not be understood to detract in any way from the clearly restrictive approach to article 1 jurisdiction adopted in Bankovic.\n",
              "Reference is now made to more recent Strasbourg decisions, in particular Al Saadoon and Mufdhi v United Kingdom (2009) 49 EHRR SE 95 and Medvedyev v France (Application No 3394/03) (unreported) 29 March 2010.\n",
              "To my mind, however, neither casts any real doubt on the Bankovic/Al Skeini analysis.\n",
              "In Al Saadoon the Court at para 62 cited para 132 of my own judgment in Al Skeini recognising the UKs jurisdiction over Mr Mousa essentially by analogy with the extra territorial exception made for embassies (an analogy recognised too in Hess v United Kingdom (1975) 2 DR 72, a Commission decision in the context of a foreign prison which had itself referred to the embassy case of X v Federal Republic of Germany) and, at paras 88 89, concluded that: . given the total and exclusive de facto, and subsequently also de jure, control exercised by the United Kingdom authorities over the premises in question, the individuals detained there, including the applicant, were within the United Kingdoms jurisdiction (see Hess v United Kingdom . ).\n",
              "This conclusion is, moreover, consistent with the dicta of the House of Lords in Al Skeini . (see para 62 above).\n",
              "In the Courts view, the applicants remained within the United Kingdoms jurisdiction until their physical transfer to the custody of the Iraqi authorities on 31 December 2008.\n",
              "It seems to me clear that the Court was there adopting, rather than doubting, the Al Skeini analysis.\n",
              "The decision of the Grand Chamber in Medvedyev is sufficiently described at para 30 of Lord Phillips judgment and paras 180 182 of Lord Mances judgment.\n",
              "I cannot see how it supports an argument for article 1 jurisdiction generally in respect of a states armed services abroad.\n",
              "All that said, I recognise that whilst there is nothing in Al Skeini (or, indeed, Bankovic) which supports the respondents argument on the present appeal, neither is there anything in the cases wholly inconsistent with it.\n",
              "True, as para 61 of Bankovic stated, article 1 reflects an essentially territorial notion of jurisdiction, other bases of jurisdiction being exceptional and requiring special justification in the particular circumstances of each case.\n",
              "And true it is too that the particular basis of exceptional jurisdiction being contended for here has not previously been recognised by the Court, the Commissions express reference to armed forces remaining under a states article 1 jurisdiction when abroad (for example in their 1975 admissibility decision in Cyprus v Turkey 2 DR 125 cited at para 49 of Lord Phillips judgment) being conspicuously omitted from more recent such formulations.\n",
              "Nevertheless, as I recognised at the outset, our armed forces abroad are subject not only to UK military law but also to the UKs general criminal and civil law and (as the Court of Appeal [2009] 3 WLR 1099 pointed out at para 29 of its judgment): As a matter of international law, no infringement of the sovereignty of the host state is involved in the United Kingdom exercising jurisdiction over its soldiers serving abroad.\n",
              "Plainly, therefore, it can respectably be argued that special justification exists for accepting an extra territorial basis of article 1 jurisdiction in their particular case.\n",
              "Arguably, moreover, this would eliminate at a stroke various apparent anomalies otherwise resulting from the position contended for by the Secretary of State for example, Convention rights attaching to a soldier in, say, a tented desert base camp (or military ambulance) but not when out with a patrol group, or, indeed, to a soldier like Private Smith who dies on base but not perhaps if his hyperthermia had resulted from inadequate care and water off base.\n",
              "The two principal reasons why for my part I would reject the respondents argument are these.\n",
              "First, because, if our armed forces abroad are within the reach of the Convention but, as Al Skeini decides, the local population are not, those responsible for the planning, control and execution of military operations will owe article 2 (and article 3) duties to our servicemen but not to the civilians whose safety is also imperilled by such operations.\n",
              "That would seem to me an odd and unsatisfactory situation (not to mention a situation unlikely to win the hearts and minds of the local population) and to sit uneasily with the growing Strasbourg case law on internal armed conflict which, it should be noted, has not hitherto been suggested to extend also to international armed conflict situations.\n",
              "Cases like Ergi v Turkey) (1998) 32 EHRR 388 (extending the principles established in McCann v United Kingdom (1995) 21 EHRR 97 to situations of armed conflict), Isayeva, Yusupova and Bazayeva v Russia (Application Nos 57947 49/00) (Isayeva I) and Isayeva v Russia (Application No 57950/00) (Isayeva II) (decisions of 24 February 2005) show, in the context respectively of Turkish army operations against the PKK in Turkey and Russian army operations against Chechnyan separatist fighters in Chechnya, the ECtHR closely scrutinising the planning, control and execution of military operations and asking whether all this has been done in such a way as to minimise, to the greatest extent possible, recourse to lethal force.\n",
              "The exigencies of armed conflict notwithstanding, Strasbourg requires the state to have taken all feasible precautions to avoid or at least minimise incidental loss of life.\n",
              "In all three cases substantive breaches of article 2 were found established.\n",
              "In Isayeva I, for instance, the Court criticised the failure of the operational command to timeously communicate the fact that civilians may have been in the vicinity of the forces on active deployment, the absence of provision of forward air controllers to direct the military aircraft participating in the attack, and the deployment of missiles with a blast radius of between 300 to 800 metres which the Court regarded as disproportionate weaponry; in Isayeva II it criticised the Russian militarys failure to adequately anticipate the arrival of Chechnyan fighters, the absence of any preemptive measures to warn or evacuate the populace, the failure to accurately quantify the operational risk of deploying aircraft armed with heavy combat weapons, and the decision to utilise what again the Court regarded as disproportionate and indiscriminate weaponry.\n",
              "As can be seen, Strasbourgs concern in these cases is essentially for the safety of civilians caught up in the conflict conflict, of course, occurring within the legal space (espace juridique) of the respective contracting states.\n",
              "Assuming Al Skeini is right, such civilians have no article 2 rights if they are outside the Council of Europe area.\n",
              "It is, however, the respondents case that the soldiers do.\n",
              "Is it really to be suggested that even outside the area of the Council of Europe Strasbourg will scrutinise a contracting states planning, control and execution of military operations to decide whether the states own forces have been subjected to excessive risk (risk, that is, which is disproportionate to the objective sought)? May Strasbourg say that a different strategy or tactic should have been adopted perhaps the use of airpower or longer range weaponry to minimise the risk to ground troops notwithstanding that this might lead to higher civilian casualties? Such problems would to my mind be inescapable were Strasbourg to find armed forces abroad within the reach of article 1 and then adopt with regard to their article 2 rights the approach hitherto taken in situations of internal armed conflict.\n",
              "My second principal reason for not holding the UKs armed forces abroad to be within the states article 1 jurisdiction is that this would be to go further than the ECtHR has yet gone, to construe article 1 as reaching further than the existing Strasbourg jurisprudence clearly shows it to reach.\n",
              "As the ECtHR itself pointed out in Bankovic (para 65), The scope of article 1 . is determinative of the very scope of the contracting parties positive obligations and, as such, of the scope and reach of the entire Convention system of human rights protection.\n",
              "Article 1 is in this respect to be contrasted with the Conventions substantive provisions and with the competence of the Convention organs, to both of which (as the Court had noted at para 64) the living instrument approach applies.\n",
              "It was for these reasons that all of us in Al Skeini decided that it was for the ECtHR to give the definitive interpretation of article 1 and that domestic courts should not construe it as having any wider reach than that established by Strasbourgs existing jurisprudence.\n",
              "The first five appellants there failed because, as Lady Hale put it (at para 91), she did not think that Strasbourg would inevitably hold that the deceased . were within the jurisdiction of the UK when they met their deaths.\n",
              "That is similarly my conclusion in the present case not, of course, with regard to Private Smith himself whose death, it is conceded, occurred in circumstances which did fall within the United Kingdoms jurisdiction, but rather with regard to our armed forces generally whilst serving abroad.\n",
              "For these reasons, together with those given by Lord Phillips and Lord Collins, I would accept the appellants argument upon the first issue.\n",
              "The second issue before us, although ostensibly raised with regard to Pte Smiths death, in reality invites our ruling as to which deaths amongst the UKs armed forces abroad require inquests that comply with the article 2 investigatory obligation.\n",
              "Plainly Pte Smiths does.\n",
              "Equally plainly, if the majority of us are right on the first issue, that would not be so in respect of most of our armed forces abroad (at any rate when not serving within the territory of another Council of Europe state).\n",
              "If, however, the majority of us are wrong on the jurisdiction issue in respect of our forces in, for example, Iraq and Afghanistan, and in any event with regard to our armed forces on, for example, active service in Northern Ireland, together with isolated cases such as that of Pte Smith, then I am in full agreement with Lord Phillips judgment on this issue and there is little that I wish to add.\n",
              "I agree that the obligation to hold an article 2 investigation arises only when there is ground for suspicion that the State may have breached a substantive obligation imposed by article 2 (Lord Phillips at para 84) which would certainly not ordinarily be the case where a soldier dies on active service abroad.\n",
              "I agree also with Lord Rodgers judgment on this point.\n",
              "As I earlier observed in R (Hurst) v London Northern District Coroner [2007] 2 AC 189, 214 (para 48): An article 2 investigative obligation only arises in the comparatively few cases where the states responsibility is or may be engaged.\n",
              "I agree also with Lord Phillips judgment at para 81 that an inquest will not always be the appropriate vehicle for discharging an article 2 investigatory obligation although I note what was said in the considered opinion of the Committee delivered by Lord Bingham in R (Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner [2004] 2 AC 182, 206 (para 47) that: in the absence of full criminal proceedings, and unless otherwise notified, a coroner should assume that his inquest is the means by which the state will discharge its procedural investigative obligation under article 2.\n",
              "I further agree with Lord Phillips that in practice the only real difference between a Jamieson inquest (R v Coroner for North Humberside and Scunthorpe, Ex p Jamieson [1995] QB 1) and a Middleton inquest is likely to be with regard to its verdict and findings, rather than its inquisitorial scope.\n",
              "As I pointed out in Hurst (paras 27 and 51), the scope of the inquiry is essentially a matter for the coroner.\n",
              "Such indeed had been eloquently recognised in Jamieson itself in the Courts judgment given there by Sir Thomas Bingham MR (at para 14 of the Courts general conclusions, p 26): It is the duty of the coroner as the public official responsible for the conduct of inquests, whether he is sitting with a jury or without, to ensure that the relevant facts are fully, fairly and fearlessly investigated.\n",
              "He is bound to recognise the acute public concern rightly aroused where deaths occur in custody.\n",
              "He must ensure that the relevant facts are exposed to public scrutiny, particularly if there is evidence of foul play, abuse or inhumanity.\n",
              "He fails in his duty if his investigation is superficial, slipshod or perfunctory.\n",
              "But the responsibility is his.\n",
              "He must set the bounds of the inquiry.\n",
              "He must rule on the procedure to be followed.\n",
              "His decisions, like those of any other judicial officer, must be respected unless and until they are varied or overruled.\n",
              "As, however, I also pointed out in Hurst (para 51), the verdict and findings are not a matter for the coroner.\n",
              "These are severely circumscribed when an inquest is confined to ascertaining by what means the deceased came by his death (a Jamieson inquest); not so where the inquest is to fulfil the article 2 investigatory obligation when it must also ascertain in what circumstances the deceased came by his death (a Middleton inquest).\n",
              "Sometimes, of course, as in McCann v United Kingdom (1995) 21 EHRR 97 (the Death on the Rock case), short verdicts in the traditional form will enable the jury to express their conclusion on the central issue canvassed at the inquest (Hurst at para 48, citing Lord Bingham in Middleton at para 31).\n",
              "Other times, perhaps generally indeed, an article 2 obligation will require the coroner or jury to state conclusions upon the important underlying issues in a way that plainly goes beyond the sort of restricted verdict available in a Jamieson inquest and in such cases a Middleton inquest is required.\n",
              "Even then, however, as noted at para 37 of Middleton, the conclusions must be conclusions of fact as opposed to expressions of opinion.\n",
              "Nor must the verdict appear to determine any question of civil liability.\n",
              "Although, as I recognised in Hurst (para 51), the coroner may sometimes choose to widen the scope of the inquiry if he recognises that article 2 conclusions of fact (and thus a Middleton verdict and findings) are required, more probably (as Lord Hope envisages at para 95 of his judgment) the coroner is likely to decide the scope of inquiry with a view rather to the exercise of his rule 43 power to make a written report to a responsible authority aimed at avoiding similar fatalities in future.\n",
              "To my mind, guidance beyond these broad generalities is quite impossible.\n",
              "This is really not an area of the law in which advisory opinions are likely to prove especially helpful.\n",
              "LORD MANCE\n",
              "Issue 1 Jurisdiction: (a) general\n",
              "The first issue before the Supreme Court is whether a soldier on military service in Iraq is subject to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom within the meaning of article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights so as to benefit from the rights guaranteed by the Human Rights Act 1998 while operating in Iraq.\n",
              "If, or at least to the extent that, such a soldier is subject to United Kingdom jurisdiction within article 1, he will be entitled to rights guaranteed by the 1998 Act.\n",
              "During the period leading up to his death, Private Smith spent time both at locations (particularly the Al Amarah stadium) constituting part of the United Kingdom army bases in Iraq and elsewhere.\n",
              "He became ill on 13 August 2003 at the stadium after performing various duties off base (particularly supervising fuel distribution in circumstances where only coalition troops were acceptable to locals in that role and were, it appears, correspondingly stretched in terms of man power).\n",
              "He was taken then by ambulance to an United Kingdom accident and emergency medical centre at Abu Naji, where he sustained a cardiac arrest and died, the cause of death being heatstroke.\n",
              "The Secretary of State for Defence accepts that, in so far as the events leading to his death occurred on base, they occurred within United Kingdom jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention and that the conduct leading to them is subject to examination for compliance with article 2 of the Convention accordingly.\n",
              "But he submits that, in so far as they occurred elsewhere, the converse applies.\n",
              "This is because, in his submission, jurisdiction under article 1 is primarily territorial and the only relevant exception, covering United Kingdom bases in Iraq, arises from the analogy of United Kingdom embassies, consulates, vessels and aircraft and places of detention abroad.\n",
              "Some members of the Court describe this issue as academic.\n",
              "But it has a potential relevance in relation to the fresh inquest which has now to be held.\n",
              "Before the Court of Appeal, the Secretary of State noted that Mrs Smiths case regarding the circumstances leading to Private Smiths death had been extended to include circumstances that took place outside the British army base and hospital, and argued originally that, as these matters took place outside the jurisdiction of the UK, they can form no part of the consideration in this case of whether the UK is in arguable breach of its obligations under article 2 (skeleton, para 16).\n",
              "By the end of the hearing, the Secretary of State had conceded that he would not submit to the new coroner in the fresh inquest that the scope of that inquest is restricted in any way by any decision by him on the applicability (or not) of the enhanced article 2 investigative obligation (appellants note and Court of Appeal judgment, para 62.) However, by letters dated respectively 22 January and 12 February 2010 the coroner has (correctly) affirmed that it is not for the parties to agree the scope of the new inquest, but for the coroner to do this in the light of the judgment of this Court, and the Secretary of State has (correctly) accepted this to be so.\n",
              "For this reason, the scope and application of article 1 and article 2 are of potential relevance to the future conduct of the fresh inquest.\n",
              "It was on the analogy of embassies, consulates, vessels and aircraft and places of detention that the House of Lords held in R (Al Skeini) v Secretary of State for Defence [2007] UKHL 26; [2008] AC 153 that Mr Mousa (an Iraqi citizen who had died, allegedly as a result of torture, in United Kingdom custody in a United Kingdom base in Iraq) was within this countrys jurisdiction under article 1.\n",
              "The respondent, Private Smiths mother, supported by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, submits that the present case, concerning the relationship between a state and its own armed forces occupying Iraq, falls within another or a more general exception to the general principle of territoriality.\n",
              "(b) Gentle\n",
              "The Secretary of State submits that the House of Lords decision in R (Gentle) v Prime Minister [2008] UKHL 20; [2008] AC 1356 is binding authority in his favour, negativing the application of any such exception in the present context.\n",
              "He refers, in particular, to Lord Binghams speech at para 8(3): Subject to limited exceptions and specific extensions, the application of the Convention is territorial: the rights and freedoms are ordinarily to be secured to those within the borders of the state and not outside.\n",
              "Here, the deaths of Fusilier Gentle and Trooper Clarke occurred in Iraq and although they were subject to the authority of the defendants they were clearly not within the jurisdiction of the UK as that expression in the Convention has been interpreted: .\n",
              "Al Skeini . paras 79, 129.\n",
              "The claimants seek to overcome that problem, in reliance on authorities such as Soering v United Kingdom (1989) 11 EHRR 439, by stressing that their complaint relates to the decision making process (or lack of it) which occurred here, even though the ill effects were felt abroad.\n",
              "There is, I think, an obvious distinction between the present case and the Soering case, and such later cases as Chahal v United Kingdom (1996) 23 EHRR 413 and D v United Kingdom (1997) 24 EHRR 423, in each of which action relating to an individual in the UK was likely to have an immediate and direct impact on that individual elsewhere.\n",
              "But I think there is a more fundamental objection: that the claimants argument, necessary to meet the objection of extra territoriality, highlights the remoteness of their complaints from the true purview of article 2.\n",
              "Paras 79 and 129 in Al Skeini, to which Lord Bingham referred, concern jurisdiction based on effective control.\n",
              "Lord Bingham evidently considered that no other exceptional head of jurisdiction applied.\n",
              "However, in so far as argument was addressed to this point, it appears to have been extremely brief (see pp 1361B C and 1363G H).\n",
              "The passage quoted from Lord Binghams speech constituted the last of three reasons why article 2 could not embrace the process of deciding on the lawfulness of a resort to arms; and it is noticeable that, at its conclusion, in dismissing the submission based on Soering, Lord Bingham reverted to his previous two reasons.\n",
              "Other members of the House focused in their express reasoning on Lord Binghams first two reasons.\n",
              "But Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hope, Lord Scott, Lord Brown and I myself at paras 16, 28, 29, 71 and 74 all also agreed in general terms with Lord Binghams reasons.\n",
              "Lord Rodger said only that his reasons were essentially the same as Lord Binghams and Lord Hoffmanns (para 45), and Lady Hale regarded her reasons as being in substantial agreement with Lord Binghams (para 61), although she expressly disagreed with him on the question whether a British soldier serving under the command and control of his superiors was within the United Kingdoms jurisdiction within the meaning of article 1 (para 60).\n",
              "Lord Carswell left that point open (para 66), and decided the case on the basis (again part of Lord Binghams first two reasons) that article 2 did not involve a duty not to go to war contrary to the UN Charter or to investigate the lawfulness of an armed conflict.\n",
              "In the above circumstances, it is open to doubt whether the first part of the passage in para 8(3) quoted above from Lord Binghams speech was part of the ratio decidendi.\n",
              "But, even if it technically was, it was not the product of the detailed argument and citation which we have now had, and it would, in my view, be wrong to refuse to reconsider it de novo.\n",
              "(c) Bankovic and the concept of jurisdiction\n",
              "Leaving Gentle aside, the submissions of all parties have, realistically, taken as their general starting point the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in Bankovic v United Kingdom (2001) 11 BHRC 435 and Al Saadoon and Mufdhi v United Kingdom (2009) 49 EHRR SE 95 and of the House of Lords in Al Skeini.\n",
              "Dicta in the House of Lords basing jurisdiction in Al Skeini on the total and exclusive de facto, and subsequently also de jure, control exercised by the United Kingdom authorities over the premises in question were referred to with approval by the European Court of Human Rights in Al Saadoon.\n",
              "The decision in Al Skeini is shortly to be reviewed in that court.\n",
              "But for present purposes the Supreme Court can and should accept it.\n",
              "This starting point avoids the need for any entirely open review of the concept of jurisdiction under article 1.\n",
              "Just how vexed that concept and how controversial the decisions in Bankovic and Al Skeini are appears from extensive literature which they have generated: see e.g. Lawson, Life after Bankovic: on the Extraterritorial Application of the European Convention on Human Rights; OBoyle, The European Convention on Human Rights and Extraterritorial Jurisdiction: A Comment on Life after Bankovic (both in F Coopman and M Kamminga, Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties; Antwerp Oxford 2004); Loucaides, Determining the Extra territorial Effect of the European Convention: Facts, Jurisprudence and the Bankovic case (2006) 4 EHRLR 391; Milanovic, From Compromise to Principle: Clarifying the Concept of State Jurisdiction in Human Rights Treaties (2008) HRLR 8(3), 411; and King, The Extraterritorial Human Rights Obligations of States (2009) HRLR 521.\n",
              "Arguments that the European Court of Human Rights was guilty of a non sequitur in assimilating the concept of jurisdiction in article 1 to the concept in general international law and in relying upon this to restrict the extra territorial application of the Convention to exceptional circumstances only (see Milanovic, p 435) do not arise for consideration.\n",
              "Nor do similar arguments that the Court in Bankovic was wrong in failing to recognise, as a separate and equal head of jurisdiction having extra territorial effect, the existence of effective authority over individuals or of actual authority or control over a given territory or person, whether lawfully or unlawfully exercised, (Lawson, p 120, Loucaides, p 399 and Milanovic, p 435).\n",
              "Whatever the merits of giving the Convention a wider reach might be de lege ferenda, we are (like, in fact more so than, the House of Lords in Al Skeini: see per Lord Rodger, para 69) only concerned with its reach de lege lata.\n",
              "Criticisms of the House of Lords approach in Al Skeini to jurisdiction based on territorial control (see King, pp 534 536 and 545 547) and suggestions that the House ought (in the light of cases such as Issa v Turkey (2004) 41 EHRR 567) to have recognised a cause and effect notion of jurisdiction (King, p 553) are also out of place in the light of the reasoning in Bankovic and Al Skeini.\n",
              "The argument on the present appeal assumes the correctness of the general principles stated in Bankovic and Al Saadoon and applied in Al Skeini.\n",
              "According to these jurisdiction in article 1 refers primarily to territorial jurisdiction, other bases of jurisdiction being exceptional and requiring special justification in the particular circumstances of each case (Bankovic, para 61).\n",
              "The Court in Bankovic explained this conclusion as follows: 59.\n",
              "As to the ordinary meaning of the relevant term in article 1 of the Convention, the Court is satisfied that, from the standpoint of public international law, the jurisdictional competence of a state is primarily territorial.\n",
              "While international law does not exclude a states exercise of jurisdiction extra territorially, the suggested bases of such jurisdiction (including nationality, flag, diplomatic and consular relations, effect, protection, passive personality and universality) are, as a general rule, defined and limited by the sovereign territorial rights of the other relevant states (Mann, The Doctrine of Jurisdiction in International Law, RdC, 1964, vol 1; Mann, The Doctrine of Jurisdiction in International Law, Twenty Years Later, RdC, 1984, vol 1; Bernhardt, Encyclopaedia of Public International Law edition 1997, vol 3, pp 55 59 Jurisdiction of States and edition 1995, vol 2, pp 337 343 Extra territorial Effects of Administrative, Judicial and Legislative Acts; Oppenheims International Law, 9th ed 1992 (Jennings and Watts), vol 1, 137; Dupuy, Droit International Public, 4th ed 1998, p 61; and Brownlie, Principles of International Law, 5th ed 1998, pp 287, 301 and 312 314). 60.\n",
              "Accordingly, for example, a states competence to exercise jurisdiction over its own nationals abroad is subordinate to that states and other states territorial competence (Higgins, Problems and Process (1994), p 73; and Nguyen Quoc Dinh, Droit International Public, 6th ed 1999 (Daillier and Pellet), p 500).\n",
              "In addition, a state may not actually exercise jurisdiction on the territory of another without the latters consent, invitation or acquiescence, unless the former is an occupying state in which case it can be found to exercise jurisdiction in that territory, at least in certain respects (Bernhardt, cited above, vol 3 at p 59 and vol 2, pp 338 340; Oppenheim, cited above, at 137; Dupuy, cited above, at pp 64 65; Brownlie, cited above, at p 313; Cassese, International Law, 2001, p 89; and, most recently, the Report on the Preferential Treatment of National Minorities by their Kin States adopted by the Venice Commission at its 48th Plenary Meeting, Venice, 19 20 October 2001).\n",
              "The Court found support for a primarily territorial approach to article 1 not only in general international law and the works cited in paras 59 and 60, but also in the travaux prparatoires (Bankovic, paras 19 21 and 63).\n",
              "During the negotiation of the Convention, the words all persons residing within the territories of the signatory States in article 1 were replaced by all persons within their jurisdiction.\n",
              "The Court noted that this was expressly on the basis that there were good grounds for extending the benefits of the Convention to all persons in the territories of the signatory States.\n",
              "However, it is not without significance that the replacement phrase adopted the word jurisdiction, rather than territories; and also that the Court itself has recognised, by the exceptions which it has endorsed, that the Convention is not exclusively confined in its application to persons within the territories of the signatory States.\n",
              "Lawson (cited above) points out (p 88) that the original proposal was to replace residing in by living in, but that the drafting sub committee noting that the aim was to widen as far as possible the categories of persons who are to benefit by the guarantees contained in the Convention proposed the replacement of residing within by within the jurisdiction (or, in French, relevant de leur jurisdiction).\n",
              "The use of the more flexible notion within the jurisdiction, with its potentially wider jurisprudential connotations, was clearly deliberate, even if it is not unlikely that the drafters did not give much thought at all to any extraterritorial impact of the Convention (Lawson, p 90; and see also Loucaides, above, p 397).\n",
              "Jurisdiction in general international law exists in the form of (a) jurisdiction to prescribe or legislate (and, as a subsidiary aspect, adjudicate), which is primarily territorial but generally also regarded as extending to a states nationals wherever they are, and (b) jurisdiction to enforce what is prescribed, which is usually only territorial (and does not usually exist, for example, against the persons of a states nationals, while they remain abroad): see Dr F A Mann in the writings cited in Bankovic at para 59, particularly RdC, 1964, pp 13, 22 et seq. and 127 et seq, and RdC, 1984, Chaps I and II, the Reinstatement of the Law Third: Restatement of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, para 401 and Alcom Ltd v Republic of Colombia [1984] AC 580, 600C, per Lord Diplock.\n",
              "In drawing on the conception of jurisdiction in general international law (while also reminding itself of the Conventions special character as a human rights treaty: para 57), the Court was (as Lord Rodger noted in Al Skeini, para 64) relating the scope of the Convention to the existence of a pre existing relationship between the relevant state and the victim.\n",
              "For the Convention to apply, the mutual relationship must be one under which the state possessed and was able to enforce lawful authority and power over the victim and the victim was in return under and entitled to the states protection.\n",
              "Jurisdiction in international law is, as Dr Mann said (RdC, 1964, p 13), concerned with the states right of regulation or, in the incomparably pithy language of Mr Justice Holmes, with the right to apply the law to the acts of men.\n",
              "This means that there must be, translated to the international legal sphere, a similar bond of reciprocal allegiance to that identified domestically as existing between sovereign and subject in Calvins Case (1608) 7 Co Rep 1a; 77 ER 377: duplex et reciprocum ligamen; quia sicut subditus regi tenetur ad obedientiam, ita rex subdito tenetur ad protectionem; merito igitur ligeantia dicitur ab ligando, quia continet in se duplex ligamen.\n",
              "A states international jurisdiction, based on this reciprocal bond, respects the matching jurisdiction of other states based on their mutual relationship with those within their territories and their nationals.\n",
              "In international law, each state owes duties to protect those within its jurisdiction.\n",
              "If state A infringes the fundamental human rights of a person subject to state Bs jurisdiction, then, although that person may have no direct right against state A, it may become state Bs duty to pursue the matter at the international level against state A.\n",
              "In the same vein, the Court in Bankovic noted that the Convention was designed to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties (para 80) engagements which cannot be regarded as having been undertaken to benefit everyone in the world at large.\n",
              "Consistently with the above, in Dr Manns writings, jurisdiction in international law is thus associated with sovereignty: it is an aspect of sovereignty, it is coextensive with and, indeed, incidental to, but also limited by the states sovereignty (RdC, 1964, pp 24 31, esp p 30; see also RdC, 1984, p 20).\n",
              "In Bankovic itself, the only connection with the United Kingdom consisted in the act of bombing Belgrade which was alleged to constitute a breach of the Convention (a pure cause and effect notion of jurisdiction).\n",
              "In that context, it is unsurprising that the Court should emphasise that the Convention was not designed to be applied throughout the world, even in respect of the conduct of contracting states (para 80) and should underline the significance of a pre existing reciprocal relationship under which sovereignty of one sort or another was legitimately possessed and exercised.\n",
              "In Al Skeini (see paras 6, 61, 90, 97 and 132) the House of Lords decided that the United Kingdom as an occupying power did not, except within its military bases, have sufficient effective control over any territory of Iraq to bring such territory within its jurisdiction under article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n",
              "The present appeal raises a different question, whether the United Kingdom had sufficient authority under international law over its own forces in Iraq for them to be regarded as within its jurisdiction under article 1.\n",
              "(d) The respondents case\n",
              "For present purposes, the respondent accepts the approach taken by the Court in Bankovic and Al Saadoon and by the House in Al Skeini.\n",
              "But she relies on its underlying rationale the limitation of jurisdiction by reference to the limitations of sovereignty and the need to avoid conflicts of jurisdiction.\n",
              "This rationale appears with clarity in both paras 59 and 60 cited above.\n",
              "The suggested bases of extra territorial jurisdiction are, as a general rule, defined and limited by the sovereign territorial rights of the other relevant States. [A] States competence to exercise jurisdiction over its own nationals abroad is subordinate to that States and other States territorial competence; and in addition a State may not actually exercise jurisdiction on the territory of another without the latters consent, invitation or acquiescence, unless the former is an occupying State in which case it can be found to exercise jurisdiction in that territory, at least in certain respects.\n",
              "In the respondents submission, the relationship between the United Kingdom and its armed forces in Iraq meets all these requirements for recognising that it involved in August 2003 the legitimate and effective exercise of jurisdiction, in the prescriptive, the adjudicatory and the enforcement senses.\n",
              "The United Kingdom was in August 2003 exercising its authority lawfully in Iraq, with the consent of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), over United Kingdom troops including Private Smith, a United Kingdom citizen.\n",
              "By CPA Order No 17 issued in June 2003, the CPA formalised the status and arrangements governing the presence of the multinational force (MNF), which included the United Kingdoms armed forces, in Iraq.\n",
              "The MNF was given, inter alia, the right to enter into, remain in and depart from Iraq (section 13), freedom of movement without delay throughout Iraq (section 7), freedom of radio communications (section 6), the right to use without cost such areas for headquarters, camps or other premises as might be necessary as well as to use, free of cost or where this was not practicable at the most favourable rate, water, electricity and other public utilities and facilities (section 9).\n",
              "Importantly, by section 2 the MNF, its personnel, property, funds and assets were immune from Iraqi legal process and all MNF personnel were expressed to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of their Sending States.\n",
              "Further, the respondent submits, the CPA was in issuing CPA Order No 17 operating with the legal mandate of the Security Council, which by Resolution 1483 adopted on 22 May 2003 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, had recognised the specific authorities, responsibilities, and obligations under applicable international law of these states as occupying powers under unified command (the Authority), and called upon the Authority (in practice the CPA) consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and other relevant international law, to promote the welfare of the Iraqi people through the effective administration of the territory.\n",
              "The respondent therefore submits that there would be no interference with Iraqi sovereignty and no attempt to impose Convention standards on Iraq or anyone other than the British state, by recognising the existence of Convention obligations as between the United Kingdom and nationals like Private Smith serving in its armed forces in Iraq.\n",
              "There would be no question of Private Smith being brought within the Convention merely by virtue of the fact that he was a victim of an alleged breach of article 2.\n",
              "On the contrary, the relationship of command and control under which Private Smith served gave the United Kingdom a broad protective capability and responsibility, which meant that a wide range of Convention rights could be effectively secured for his benefit.\n",
              "Further, this being an exceptional head of jurisdiction, it was, in the respondents further submission, no objection if or that there might be some Convention rights which could not be secured; the objection, identified by the House in Al Skeini, to any application of the Convention based on tailoring and restricting Convention rights did not apply to the exceptional heads of jurisdiction.\n",
              "In this connection, the Secretary of State points to para 130 in Lord Browns speech in Al Skeini, to which I return below (para 193).\n",
              "These are forceful submissions, but they require closer analysis of the status of the United Kingdoms armed forces in Iraq.\n",
              "Paras 59 and 60 of the Courts judgment in Bankovic recognise that state A may exercise jurisdiction on or in the territory of state B either (a) with the consent, invitation or acquiescence of state B or (b) as an occupying state at least in certain respects.\n",
              "I will consider in turn these alternative bases of jurisdiction (a) and (b).\n",
              "But first I examine three specific cases of the exceptional extraterritorial jurisdiction contemplated in paras 59 and 60 of Bankovic.\n",
              "These were identified and analysed by Lord Brown in Al Skeini at paras 118 to 122.\n",
              "(e) Cases of exceptional extra territorial jurisdiction\n",
              "The first involves the forcible removal by state A from state B and with state Bs consent of a person wanted for trial in state A (Al Skeini, paras 118 119).\n",
              "Within this category, Lord Brown put calan v Turkey (2005) 41 EHRR 985, where the European Court of Human Rights said: 91.\n",
              "The Court notes that the applicant was arrested by members of the Turkish security forces inside an aircraft registered in Turkey in the international zone of Nairobi Airport.\n",
              "It is common ground that, directly after being handed over to the Turkish officials by the Kenyan officials, the applicant was under effective Turkish authority and therefore within the jurisdiction of that state for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention, even though in this instance Turkey exercised its authority outside its territory.\n",
              "It is true that the applicant was physically forced to return to Turkey by Turkish officials and was under their authority and control following his arrest and return to Turkey (see, in this respect, the aforementioned decisions in Snchez Ramirez v France (1996) 86 A DR 155 and Freda v Italy (1980) 21 DR 250, and, by converse implication, Bankovi v Belgium [(2001) 11 BHRC 435].\n",
              "Lord Brown commented that, in circumstances where the forcible removal was effected with the full cooperation of the relevant foreign authorities and with a view to the applicants criminal trial in the respondent state, it was unsurprising that the Grand Chamber in calan had felt able to distinguish Bankovic by converse implication.\n",
              "The inference from para 91 in calan is that, if (a) state A exercises authority over an individual in state B by consent of state B, and (b) it does so in order to lead to exercise of state As ordinary domestic jurisdiction over that individual, then it is throughout exercising jurisdiction over that individual under article 1.\n",
              "The present case is not precisely on all fours (not least, because the United Kingdoms authority over its armed forces was to be exercised in Iraq), but, if the case could be analysed in terms of consent, that could hardly be critical in principle.\n",
              "A second exceptional category was considered by Lord Brown in para 121 with reference back to para 109(4)(iii), where he introduced the category in these terms: Certain other cases where a states responsibility could, in principle, be engaged because of acts which produced effects or were performed outside their own territory (para 69).\n",
              "Drozd and Janousek v France and Spain (1992) 14 EHRR 745, at para 91, is the only authority specifically referred to in Bankovic as exemplifying this class of exception to the general rule.\n",
              "Drozd, however, contemplated no more than that, if a French judge exercised jurisdiction extraterritorially in Andorra in his capacity as a French judge, then anyone complaining of a violation of his Convention rights by that judge would be regarded as being within Frances jurisdiction.\n",
              "In para 121, Lord Brown further explained this category: Another category, similarly recognised in Bankovic, was Drozd (see para 109(4)(iii) above ) into which category can also be put cases like X and Y v Switzerland (1977) 9 DR 57 and Gentilhomme, Schaff Benhadji and Zerouki v France (Application Nos 48205/99, 48207/99 and 48209/99) (unreported) 14 May 2002.\n",
              "In X and Y v Switzerland, Switzerland was held to be exercising jurisdiction where, pursuant to treaty provisions with Liechtenstein, it legislated for immigration matters in both states, prohibiting X from entering either.\n",
              "In Gentilhomme, France operated French state schools in Algeria, again pursuant to a treaty arrangement.\n",
              "Drozd concerned complaints brought by defendants tried in Andorra against France and Spain as being allegedly responsible for non observance of the Convention by persons from these countries nominated to sit as judges in Andorra.\n",
              "Its significance is that the European Court of Human Rights found it necessary to consider whether the judges acts could be attributed to France and Spain, even though they were not performed on the territory of those states (Drozd, para 91).\n",
              "As the Court explained in Bankovic (para 69) the impugned acts could not, in the circumstances, be attributed to the respondent states because the judges in question were not acting in their capacity as French or Spanish judges and as the Andorran courts functioned independently of the respondent states (para 69).\n",
              "Rix LJ in the Divisional Court in Al Skeini (paras 158 166 and 256 257) subjected Drozd to close scrutiny, and was puzzled by its reasoning.\n",
              "He noted that, if the judges sitting in Andorra had been acting in their capacities as French and Spanish judges, then in this most important legal sphere, in one sense the heart of what is meant by jurisdiction, there would have been a form of extension of French and Spanish jurisdiction into the territory of Andorra, and regarded Drozd as too much of a special case to provide any firm foundation for a submission that personal jurisdiction exercised extraterritorially by state agents or authorities is a broad principle of jurisdiction under article 1 (para 257).\n",
              "Special case though it was, Drozd points to the possibility that certain relationships, such as those between a national judge and those under his or her authority, may attract the operation of the Convention, irrespective of whether they take place within the territory of the judges state.\n",
              "Gentilhomme is of interest, not just because it recognises the operation by France in Algeria of French schools with the consent of Algeria as capable of amounting to an exercise of jurisdiction by France in Algeria within the scope of article 1, but also because, on the facts, France was held not responsible.\n",
              "The complainants children had, under French law, dual French and Algerian nationality but, under Algerian law, were only recognised as having Algerian nationality.\n",
              "The complaint related to the refusal to admit them to the French schools in Algeria.\n",
              "However, this was the result of a decision taken by Algeria unilaterally, with which France had no option but to comply although that decision was in breach of a declaration of cultural co operation which the two countries had signed on 19 March 1962.\n",
              "The Court held that the conduct complained of could not be attributed to France, and the complaint was accordingly incompatible with the Convention ratione personae.\n",
              "The possibility of exercising jurisdiction abroad by consent, invitation or acquiescence of the overseas state, to which the Court had referred in Bankovic, est subordonne la competence territoriale de cet autre Etat, et, en principe, un Etat ne peut concrtement exerciser sa jurisdiction sur le territoire dun autre Etat sans le consentement, linvitation ou lacquiescement de ce dernier (Bankovic, paras 59 60).\n",
              "This appears clearly to indicate that exceptional jurisdiction may be tailored, in extent and in the liability to which it is capable of giving rise, by reference to the scope of the authority for the exercise of which abroad consent is given.\n",
              "The third exceptional category involves the activities of [a states] diplomatic or consular agents abroad and on board craft and vessels registered in, or flying the flag of, that state (Bankovic, para 73, Al Skeini, paras 109(4)(ii) and 122).\n",
              "As regards the activities of diplomatic or consular agents abroad, the critical feature is, again, the consent of the foreign state, in accordance with general principles of international law, to the exercise within its territory of the authority of the sending state by representatives of that state.\n",
              "As Lord Brown noted in para 122, jurisdiction within article 1 has been held to exist both in relation to nationals of the sending state and even in relation to foreigners.\n",
              "In relation to nationals, the existence of such jurisdiction is more obvious than it is, perhaps, in relation to foreigners.\n",
              "The present case is concerned with the existence of jurisdiction in Iraq in relation to British soldiers.\n",
              "As to a states activities on board craft and vessels registered in, or flying the flag of, that state, the relevant consideration is, once again, that the state has under international law recognised authority and control over such craft and vessels since the view that a ship is a floating part of state territory has long fallen into disrepute (Brownlies Principles of Public International Law, 7th ed (2008), p 318).\n",
              "The recent decision of a seventeen member Grand Chamber in Medvedyev v France (Application No 3394/03) (29 March 2010) is not without interest in this connection.\n",
              "The Winner, a Cambodian vessel was engaged on drug trafficking in the high seas (Cape Verde).\n",
              "Belying its name, it was detected and boarded by the French authorities, who detained the crew on board and took them on the vessel to France for trial.\n",
              "France was, but Cambodia was not, party to the relevant international drug trafficking conventions, which did not in the circumstances authorise the arrest by France of the Cambodian vessel.\n",
              "Nevertheless, Cambodia had given France specific ad hoc authorisation to intercept, inspect and take legal action against the ship.\n",
              "A majority of the Court considered that the crew were within the jurisdiction of France for the purposes of article 1 on the simple basis of France having exercised full and exclusive control over the Winner and its crew, at least de facto, from the time of its interception, in a continuous and uninterrupted manner until they were tried in France (contrast Bankovic, cited above) (para 67).\n",
              "Bankovic was cited in para 64, where the Court noted that it was only in exceptional cases that acts of the Contracting States performed, or producing effects, outside their territories can constitute an exercise of jurisdiction by them for the purposes of article 1, and that This excluded situations, however, where as in the Bankovic case what was at issue was an instantaneous extraterritorial act, as the provisions of article 1 did not admit of a cause and effect notion of jurisdiction (Bankovic, para 75).\n",
              "Having accepted that France had jurisdiction under article 1, the majority in Medvedyev went on to hold the detention of the crew unjustified, on the basis that, although international as well as domestic law was capable of shaping a procedure prescribed by law within article 5.1 (para 79), Cambodias ad hoc authorisation did not meet the requirements under article 5.1 of clearly defined and foreseeable law (paras 99 100).\n",
              "Presumably foreshadowing that conclusion, the majority appear in para 67 to have endorsed the possibility of a purely factual (albeit unlawfully exercised) concept of jurisdiction under article 1.\n",
              "In contrast, seven judges, dissenting from the majoritys conclusion under article 5.1, accepted that article 1 applied on the simple basis that the Winner with the agreement of the flag state was undeniably within the jurisdiction of France for the purposes of article 1 (para 10).\n",
              "That state B may authorise state A to exercise jurisdiction which would otherwise belong to state B for the purposes of article 1 is on any view consistent with the principles in Bankovic, paras 59 60, as well as with the three specific categories of extraterritorial jurisdiction which I have been considering.\n",
              "(f) The present case\n",
              "The present case falls directly within none of these specific categories.\n",
              "But all three categories depend upon the exercise by state A abroad of state power and authority over individuals, particularly nationals of state A, by consent, invitation or acquiescence of the foreign state B. They exemplify in this respect one underlying theme of paras 59 and 60 in Bankovic.\n",
              "The first question is whether the present case represents an example of the exercise by state A (here the United Kingdom) of its lawful authority and power over its nationals in state B (Iraq) with the consent of state B.\n",
              "If it does not, then it will be necessary to consider the alternative possibility mentioned in Bankovic, para 60, namely that the United Kingdom had, as an occupying power, jurisdiction under international law over its armed forces wherever they were in Iraq.\n",
              "(g) Exercise of jurisdiction by consent\n",
              "The answer to the first question depends upon the position of the CPA.\n",
              "The CPAs origin, role and status were examined in Al Skeini, particularly by Rix LJ in the Divisional Court at [2004] EWHC 2911 (Admin); [2007] QB 140, paras 9 39.\n",
              "Following their invasion of Iraq, the United States and United Kingdom became occupying powers within and subject to the provisions of the Hague Convention 1907 and the Fourth Geneva Convention 1949 (Rix LJ, para 11).\n",
              "The CPA was the creation of a freedom message issued in that capacity by United States General Tommy Franks on 16 April 2003 (Rix LJ, para 14).\n",
              "The formation and purpose of the CPA (to exercise powers of government temporarily and to transfer responsibility for administration to representative Iraqi authorities as soon as possible) were reported by letter by the two governments permanent representatives to the Security Council, The Security Council on 22 May 2003 adopted Resolution 1483 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, that is as a measure taken to maintain or restore international peace and security.\n",
              "Resolution 1483 noted the contents of the letter and, as stated in para 171 above, recognised the specific authorities, responsibilities, and obligations under applicable international law of these states as occupying powers under unified command (the Authority) and called upon the Authority (in practice the CPA) consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and other relevant international law, to promote the welfare of the Iraqi people through the effective administration of the territory (para 4).\n",
              "But it also supported a transformative process in Iraq, through the formation, by the people of Iraq with the help of the Authority, of an Iraqi interim administration as a transitional administration run by Iraqis, until an internationally recognised, representative government is established by the people of Iraq and assumes the responsibilities of the Administration (Resolution 1483, para 9).\n",
              "The CPA had by regulation R1 dated 16 May 2003 already declared that there were vested in the CPA all executive, legislative and judicial authority necessary to achieve its objectives, to be exercised under relevant UN Security Council resolutions. (anticipating in this respect by some 6 days the effect of Resolution 1483, a draft of which was by then publicly available).\n",
              "In June 2003 the CPA issued CPA Order No 17, which formalised the status and arrangements covering the United Kingdoms occupying forces (para 171 above).\n",
              "To complete the picture, on 13 July 2003, following two national conferences and widespread consultation, the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) announced its formation and was recognised formally by the CPA by regulation R6, in line with para 9 of Security Council Resolution 1483, as the principal body of an Iraqi interim administration, with which the CPA would consult and co ordinate on all matters involving the temporary governance of Iraq.\n",
              "The Security Council by Resolution 1500 on 14 August 2003 welcomed the establishment of the IGC as an important step towards the formation by the people of Iraq of an internationally recognized, representative government that will exercise the sovereignty of Iraq.\n",
              "In its later Resolution 1511 of 16 October 2003, the Security Council, again acting under Chapter VII, reaffirm[ed] the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, and underscore[ed] in that context, the temporary nature of the exercise by the Coalition Provisional Authority (Authority) of the specific responsibilities, authorities, and obligations under applicable international law recognized and set forth in resolution 1483 (2003) .\n",
              "The IGC eventually dissolved itself on 1 June 2004, and on 28 June 2008 the CPA transferred authority to the Iraqi Interim Government, which became the sole sovereign authority of Iraq (Rix LJ, para 38).\n",
              "The CPA was thus exercising, and was recognised by the Security Council as having under international law, responsibility for the temporary governance and administration of Iraq throughout the relevant period from the end of May to August 2003.\n",
              "In the Court of Appeal in Al Skeini [2005] EWCA Civ 1609; [2007] QB 140, para 123, Brooke LJ said that the CPA, which was not an instrument of the UK government, had the overall executive, legislative and judicial authority in Iraq whenever it deemed it necessary to exercise such authority to achieve its objectives.\n",
              "In the House of Lords (para 83) Lord Rodger expressed himself as being in agreement with paras 120 to 128 of Brooke LJs judgment when concluding that the United Kingdom lacked effective control of Basra and its surrounding areas.\n",
              "The CPA expressly endorsed and authorised the presence of the United Kingdoms armed forces in Iraq, and it had the support of Security Council Resolution 1483 in so acting.\n",
              "But that does not necessarily mean that the CPA equates with the state of Iraq for the purposes of consenting to the presence of foreign troops under international law.\n",
              "The CPA, although separate from the United Kingdom government, was the creature of the occupying forces, and Security Council Resolutions 1483 and 1511 were careful to refer to the CPA in terms consistent with this.\n",
              "An analysis which relies upon the Security Councils recognition of the CPAs role and upon CPA Order No 17 as a basis for saying that the state of Iraq consented to the presence and activities of United Kingdom forces in Iraq may be regarded as essentially circular: the CPA owed its existence, rights and responsibilities to the presence and activities of the occupying forces, and the Security Councils Resolution was drafted on a basis which can be said merely to recognise this truth.\n",
              "On the other hand, if that is so, then it is also true there was during the period May to August 2003 no other body which could claim to represent the state of Iraq, and a correspondingly reduced risk of any objectionable clash of sovereignty.\n",
              "(g) Exercise of jurisdiction over occupying forces\n",
              "This brings me to the other head of extra territorial jurisdiction mentioned in Bankovic, para 60, although not the subject of detailed analysis there or in Al Skeini: that is jurisdiction as an occupying force.\n",
              "The laws of war apply whatever the legitimacy or otherwise of the casus belli.\n",
              "They would not otherwise have much point.\n",
              "In the present case, the specific authorities, responsibilities, and obligations under applicable international law of the occupying forces, as well as the role of the CPA, were also endorsed by Security Council Resolution 1483.\n",
              "The European Court of Human Rights recognised in para 60 in Bankovic that occupation can give jurisdiction at least in certain respects, and referred to inter alia Oppenheims International Law (vol I Peace) (9th ed) (1992) para 137.\n",
              "This states that: International law, however, gives every state a right to claim exemption from local jurisdiction, chiefly for itself, its Head of State, its diplomatic envoys, its warships and its armed forces abroad.\n",
              "In relation to the words and its armed forces, footnote 19 refers to paras 556 558, which, in relation to belligerent occupation of foreign territory, refer in turn by footnote 4 to paras 166 172b of volume II Disputes,War and Neutrality of the same work (7th ed) (1952).\n",
              "Para 166 states that, in modern international law: although the occupant in no wise acquires sovereignty over such territory through the mere fact of having occupied it, he actually exercises for the time being military authority over it.\n",
              "As he thereby prevents the legitimate sovereign from exercising his authority, and claims obedience for himself from the inhabitants, he must administer the country, not only in the interest of his own military Para 169 continues: advantage, but also, at any rate so far as possible, for the public benefit of the inhabitants.\n",
              "As the occupant actually exercises authority, and as the legitimate Government is prevented from exercising its authority, the occupant acquires a temporary right of administration over the territory and its inhabitants; .\n",
              "In carrying out [the administration] the occupant is totally independent of the constitution and law of the territory, since occupation is an aim of warfare, and the maintenance and safety of his forces and the purpose of war, stand in the foreground of his interest, and must be promoted under all circumstances and conditions.\n",
              "But, although as regards the safety of his army and the purpose of war the occupant is vested with an almost absolute power, as he is not the sovereign of the territory he has no right to make changes in the laws, or in the administration, other than those which are temporarily necessitated by his interest in the maintenance and safety of his army and the realisation of the purpose of war.\n",
              "On the contrary, he has the duty of administering the country according to the existing laws and the existing rules of administration; he must ensure public order and safety, must respect family honour and rights, individual lives, private property, religious convictions and liberty.\n",
              "It has been observed that the transformative aspect of Resolution 1483 (para 184 above) and the transformation in Iraqi society and governance which the CPA actually implemented do not reconcile easily with the traditional principles governing occupation stated in Oppenheim: see Adam Roberts, The End of Occupation (2005) ICLQ 27 and Transformative Military Occupation: Applying the Laws of War and Human Rights (2006) 100 AJIL 580, 604 618 and Nehal Bhuta, The antimonies of transformative occupation (2005) EJIL 721.\n",
              "It seems clear that neither the occupying states nor the Security Council viewed the situation as one in which there was, after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, any legitimate sovereign.\n",
              "It also seems improbable that the wide ranging and in certain respects fundamental measures introduced by the CPA for the temporary governance of Iraq (as described by Rix LJ in the Divisional Court in Al Skeini at paras 19 to 26) would fit with the traditional duty of administering the country according to the existing laws and the existing rules of administration to which Oppenheim refers in para 169.\n",
              "However, I think it unnecessary to consider how far and on what basis the occupation of Iraq may have had features going beyond that of traditional belligerent occupation.\n",
              "What is important for present purposes is that the status even of a traditional occupying state is recognised and regulated by international law, and that it is one in which as regards the safety of his army and the purpose of war the occupant is vested with an almost absolute power, and in which the occupant has the right to claim immunity for its armed forces from local jurisdiction.\n",
              "In the context of Bankovic, the European Court may in para 60 have been thinking primarily of jurisdiction exercised by a state through occupying forces over local inhabitants.\n",
              "But to the extent that such jurisdiction exists, it does so only because of the states pre existing authority and control over its own armed forces.\n",
              "An occupying state cannot have any jurisdiction over local inhabitants without already having jurisdiction over its own armed forces, in each case in the sense of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "That is not of course to equate a states jurisdiction over third parties with its pre existing and more widely based jurisdiction over its own armed forces (see further para 191 below).\n",
              "In providing for the occupying forces to have immunity from Iraqi legal process, CPA Order No 17 reflected the general principle of state immunity, under international and common law, precluding civil suits in one state against a foreign state or its servants in respect of sovereign activities of that foreign state: see eg Littrell v United States of America (No 2) [1995] 1 WLR 82, Holland v Lampen Wolfe [2000] 1 WLR 1573 and Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [2006] UKHL 26; [2007] 1 AC 270 (the position relating to torture not being relevant on this appeal) and, under general international law, para 137 of Oppenheim (para 187 above).\n",
              "No such general immunity today exists under English law as between the United Kingdom and those within its territory or having its nationality, whether the conduct occurs within or outside the United Kingdom.\n",
              "Soldiers can bring proceedings in England against the Ministry of Defence in respect of any breach of the states common law duty of care towards them: Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987, section 1.\n",
              "That such liability is capable of arising in respect of operations or activity anywhere in the world appears implicit in section 1 of the 1987 Act (read in the light of section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 which it repealed) as well as in section 2 of the 1987 Act.\n",
              "The United Kingdom government is thus already liable to receive claims at common law by soldiers serving in Iraq based, for example, on allegations of failure to take proper care in relation to their safety, other than in the context of active operations against an enemy.\n",
              "A distinction between actual operations against an enemy (during the course of which no common law duty of care exists) and other activities of combatant services in time of war was drawn in Shaw Savill and Albion Co Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia (1940) CLR 344, Burmah Oil Company Ltd v Lord Advocate [1965] AC 75, 110, per Lord Reid (using the term battle damage to describe the former category), Mulcahy v Minister of Defence [1996] QB 732 and Bici v Ministry of Defence [2004] EWHC 786 (QB), paras 90 100.\n",
              "It is unnecessary to examine it or its scope here.\n",
              "I can also leave undecided the question whether the doctrine of act of state might in limited circumstances make even a claim by a British subject non justiciable: see Nissan v Attorney General [1970] AC 179; Bici v Ministry of Defence (above), para 88.\n",
              "In providing for the United Kingdom to have exclusive jurisdiction, CPA Order No 17 also mirrored in effect the domestic position, whereby British soldiers are subject to United Kingdom military law wherever they serve.\n",
              "This was so under the Army Act 1955, the Air Force Act 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957 (the Service Acts), backed up by rules and regulations, including the Queens Regulations 1975, in force in 2003; and it remains so since their replacement from 31 October 2009 by the Armed Forces Act 2006.\n",
              "Although the Service Acts are largely silent on their territorial scope, it is not in dispute that their provisions governed service overseas as well as domestically: see Al Skeini, per Lord Bingham at paras 15(4) and 26.\n",
              "This is, for example, reflected in provisions for courts martial to have jurisdiction over offences committed abroad (Naval Discipline Act 1957, section 48(1)) and to sit abroad (Army Act, section 91): see also Halsburys Laws of England, Armed Forces, vol 2(2), para 303, footnote 4, noting that the jurisdiction of army and air force courts martial to try offences committed outside the United Kingdom is to be inferred from the fact that each of the offence creating provisions provides that the offence in question is committed by any person subject to military or air force law without any limiting words as to where the offence must be committed.\n",
              "Section 70(1) of the Army Act has made it an offence for any person subject to military law to commit a civil law offence anywhere in the world.\n",
              "Section 367 of the 2006 Act now provides expressly that Every member of the regular forces is subject to service law at all times.\n",
              "(h) Conclusion on issue of jurisdiction\n",
              "In the light of the above, it is in my view possible to give a clear answer to the question whether the United Kingdom had jurisdiction under international law over its armed forces wherever they were in Iraq.\n",
              "If the United Kingdom did not, then no state did.\n",
              "The invasion clearly and finally ousted any previous government.\n",
              "The United Kingdom was the only power exercising and having under international law authority over its soldiers.\n",
              "In so far as there was any civil administration in Iraq, it consented to this.\n",
              "If the CPAs consent is disregarded as coming from what was, in effect, an emanation of the two occupying powers, then the United Kingdom was, and was by Security Council Resolution 1483 recognised as, an occupying power in Iraq.\n",
              "Bankovic indicates that one basis on which the UK could be regarded as having had jurisdiction over its forces in Iraq would have been by consent of the state of Iraq.\n",
              "It would be strange if the position were different in the absence of any Iraqi government to give such consent, or therefore to object, to the exercise of such jurisdiction by the UK over its occupying forces.\n",
              "As an occupying power, the UK was necessarily in complete control of the armed forces by which it achieved such occupation, and had under international law an almost absolute power as regards their safety (Oppenheim, para 169, above), as well as duties regarding the effective administration of Iraq and the restoration of security and stability, to be performed through such forces.\n",
              "The United Kingdom did not have such effective control over the whole of the area of Southern Iraq or even Basra as could cause such area to be equated with territory of the United Kingdom, or therefore to require the United Kingdom to ensure the full range of Convention rights to all within it.\n",
              "It is, however, a different matter to suggest that the United Kingdom ceased to have jurisdiction over its armed forces (with the consequence that it ceased to owe them any further Convention duty) whenever they were out of base; and the United Kingdoms jurisdiction over its own armed forces within article 1 does not mean that it had jurisdiction within article 1 over all or any other persons with whom those armed forces came into contact off base.\n",
              "The actual feasibility of the United Kingdom assuring and providing protection for its armed forces in Iraq depends on the circumstances, including the circumstances and place in which such forces are serving.\n",
              "But to distinguish fundamentally between the existence of the protective duties on the part of the United Kingdom towards its armed forces at home and abroad also appears to me as unrealistic under the Convention as it is at common law.\n",
              "The relationship between the United Kingdom and its armed forces is effectively seamless.\n",
              "Members of the armed forces serve under the same discipline and conditions wherever they are, and they are required to go wherever they are ordered.\n",
              "The relationship is not territorial, it depends in every context and respect on a reciprocal bond, of authority and control on the one hand and allegiance and obedience on the other.\n",
              "The armed forces serve on that basis.\n",
              "The compact is that they will receive the support and protection of the country they serve.\n",
              "I recognise that these considerations could apply even in a case where the United Kingdom did not have under international law a recognised role, like that of an occupying power which it had in Iraq.\n",
              "That may, on another day, lead back to re examination of statements (such as that in Medvedyev: see para 182 above) which contemplate the possibility that article 1 may embrace purely factual, though unlawfully exercised, jurisdiction.\n",
              "That possibility does not however require consideration on this appeal.\n",
              "Where, as here, the United Kingdom was present in Iraq, both with the consent of the only civil administrative authority that existed and in any event as an occupying power recognised as such under international law by the Security Council, there is in my view an irresistible case for treating the United Kingdoms jurisdiction over its armed forces as extending to soldiers serving in Iraq for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "In Al Skeini (para 53) Lord Rodger said, in the context of interpreting the scope of the Human Rights Act 1998, that where a public authority has power to operate outside of the United Kingdom and does so legitimately for example, with the consent of the other state in the absence of any indication to the contrary it would only be sensible to treat the public authority, so far as possible, in the same way as when it operates at home.\n",
              "Similar thinking applies to the scope of a states jurisdiction under article 1 of the Convention, and is not only consistent with, but positively supported by, the Courts reasoning in Bankovic.\n",
              "In the present case, Lord Collins, whose judgment I have read after formulating my own, identifies a number of cases where commonsense in his view justifies a recognition of extra territorial jurisdiction within article 1 albeit necessarily of a limited nature tailored to the context (see paras 281, 301 and 306).\n",
              "I agree, but in my view commonsense also suggests a similar analysis of the relationship between the United Kingdom and the British army.\n",
              "Is such a conclusion precluded on the basis that Convention rights cannot properly be tailored? I do not believe so.\n",
              "We are concerned with an exceptional head of jurisdiction.\n",
              "In Al Skeini, Lord Brown said this at para 130: Realistically the concept of the indivisibility of the Convention presents no problem in the categories of cases discussed in paras 119 126 above: those concern highly specific situations raising only a limited range of Convention rights.\n",
              "This passage might, on one view, be read as suggesting that there is something inherent in the exceptional categories of cases discussed in paras 119 to 126 which means that it could never realistically be suggested that the state was in such cases under any general Convention obligation to secure the Convention rights.\n",
              "But it is not obvious why.\n",
              "The true explanation must be that in circumstances falling within one of the exceptional categories the states Convention duties are limited to those falling within the scope of the relationship giving rise to the exception in question.\n",
              "The consul cannot be expected to guarantee the full range of Convention rights, any more than can a state exercising authority by consent in other circumstances, such as those existing where it takes someone into custody (calan), or operates a school (Gentilhomme) or mans a court (Drozd), abroad by consent of the foreign state.\n",
              "The United Kingdom could not guarantee the full range of Convention rights to foreign litigants using its courts.\n",
              "Yet, once a person brings a civil action in the courts or tribunals of a state, there indisputably exists a jurisdictional link for the purposes of article 1: Markovic v Italy (2006) 44 EHRR 1045, para 54.\n",
              "Thus the Convention was applied, unsurprisingly in my view without anyone suggesting that it might not, as the measure of the legitimacy of claims by such nationals against the United Kingdom for refusal to up rate their pensions to the same level as those of persons residing in the United Kingdom who had made equivalent National Insurance contributions: Carson v United Kingdom (Application No 42184/05), 16 March 2010, where the claims in fact failed on the basis that persons residing within and outside the territory of the United Kingdom were not in an analogous situation.\n",
              "I add, without needing to explore this further, that, even in relation to territorially based jurisdiction, factual inability to enforce all the Convention rights, due to temporary loss of control to rebel forces, may, it appears, qualify the extent of the jurisdiction enjoyed and of the duties attaching to it: Ilacu v Moldova and Russia (2005) 40 EHRR 1040 (GC), paras 332 333.\n",
              "The United Kingdoms jurisdiction over its armed forces is essentially personal.\n",
              "The United Kingdom cannot and cannot be expected to provide in Iraq the full social and protective framework and facilities which it would be expected to provide domestically.\n",
              "But the United Kingdom could be expected to take steps to provide proper facilities and proper protection against risks falling within its responsibility or its ability to control or influence when despatching and deploying armed forces overseas.\n",
              "Will there be consequences beyond or outside any that the framers of the Convention can have contemplated, if Convention rights, and in particular those under article 2, continue to apply as between the United Kingdom and members of its armed forces serving abroad? That the obligation on states under article 1 to secure the Convention rights to everyone within their jurisdiction is, in principle, capable of applying to members of the armed forces as it does to anyone else is clear: see Engel v The Netherlands (1976) 1 EHRR 647, paras 54, 59, and en v Turkey (Application No 45824/99), 8 July 2003, para 1.\n",
              "The factors which justify exposing soldiers to the risk of death differ fundamentally from those that apply where civilian lives are at risk.\n",
              "But there is nothing that makes the Convention impossible or inappropriate of application to the relationship between the state and its armed forces as it exists in relation to overseas operations, in matters such as, for example, the adequacy of equipment, planning or training.\n",
              "See also on these points Gentle, per Lord Hope, para 19.\n",
              "Mr Eadie QC for the Secretary of State accepted in his submissions that it could be argued that to send a soldier out of the United Kingdom (or no doubt, in the light of Al Skeini, out of base) on a mission with inadequate equipment or training could involve a breach of the Convention, by analogy with the principle recognised in Soering v United Kingdom (1989) 11 EHRR 439 and referred to in Bankovic, para 68; and that coroners inquests in respect of deaths on active service in Iraq or Afghanistan have addressed such issues.\n",
              "The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights includes cases where that court has examined closely and criticised the conduct of armed forces in domestic contexts.\n",
              "Such cases start with McCann v United Kingdom (1995) 21 EHRR 97, relating to the shooting by SAS officers of members of the Provisional IRA suspected of planning to attack the Royal Anglian Regiment in Gibraltar, and include Isayeva, Yusupova and Bazayeva v Russia (Application Nos 57947 49/00), 24 February 2005, and Isayeva v Russia (Application No 57950/00), 24 February 2005, relating to the conduct of military operations by the Russian armed forces against Chechen separatist fighters which led to the deaths of civilians.\n",
              "In such cases, it appears that the exigencies of military life go to the standard and performance, rather than the existence of, any Convention duty.\n",
              "Outside the sphere of combat operations or battle damage (para 34 above), this has been held also to be the position at common law, in which connection Elias J said in Bici v Ministry of Defence, para 104 that Troops frequently have to carry out difficult and sensitive peace keeping functions, such as in Northern Ireland, whilst still being subject to common law duties of care.\n",
              "The difficulties of their task are reflected in the standard of the duty rather than by denying its applicability.\n",
              "The European Court of Human Rights has (as Lord Hope noted in Gentle, paras 18 19) itself also acknowledged that when interpreting and applying the rules of the Convention it is necessary to bear in mind the particular characteristics of military life and its effects on the situation of individual members of the armed services (Engel, para 54, and en, p 1(b)).\n",
              "Reluctance about accepting the application of article 2 to the armed forces serving abroad may be due to concerns on several scores: first, the improbability that the founding fathers of the Convention perceived that jurisdiction under article 1 would extend to such matters, second, the apparent absence from the Convention of any immunities paralleling those of combat operations or battle damage (or, perhaps, act of state) recognised at common law (para 189 above), and, third, the extent to which the Court has in practice shown itself ready to re examine and re assess minutely, after the event and in the cold light of day, the factual conduct and decision making of member states in difficult circumstances, as evidenced perhaps by some decisions already mentioned, including in particular McCann and, recently, Medvedyev.\n",
              "But none of these matters seem to me to justify giving to the concept of jurisdiction a different or more limited meaning to that which, in my view, follows from the guidance which the Court has already given, particularly in Bankovic.\n",
              "As to the first such matter, the scope and application of the Convention, as revealed over the years, would probably surprise its founding fathers in many respects, and it seems particularly unrealistic to measure the scope of article 1 (fixed though it is, rather than living) by reference to the now revealed positive meaning of article 2 (cf Lord Phillipss comment to like effect in para 54).\n",
              "As to the second and third matters, it would have been foreseeable when the Convention was concluded that combat operations against an enemy might take place in the territory of a Contracting State a context in which the Secretary of State accepts the application of the Convention.\n",
              "The armed forces have not infrequently also been involved in combat operations in bases under attack in Afghanistan or, previously, Iraq.\n",
              "On the approach accepted in Al Skeini and in Al Saadoon and Mufdhi v United Kingdom (2009) 49 EHRR SE95, the United Kingdom is already required to ensure that its armed forces enjoy whatever protection the Convention, and in particular article 2, may require in such situations.\n",
              "The possible existence of Soering type liability for sending troops out from the United Kingdom with inadequate equipment or training is also acknowledged by the Secretary of State (para 196 above).\n",
              "If (as to which I express no view) the Convention contains no homologue of the common law immunity in respect of combat operations or battle damage, that is, therefore, a concern that already exists in contexts recognised as falling within Contracting States jurisdiction under article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "It is not a guide to the scope of article 1.\n",
              "In fact, the Convention does contain at least one provision aimed at addressing this concern.\n",
              "Under article 15 of the Convention states are, in time of war or other public emergency, permitted, to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, to derogate from article 2 in respect of deaths resulting from lawful acts of war.\n",
              "By article 15 the Contracting States were catering for the natural concern that military operations against an enemy should not be unduly hampered.\n",
              "Finally, the Secretary of State submits, even if a soldier in Private Smiths position might be thought to be entitled to the protection of the Convention (and of article 2 in particular) at all times while serving overseas, whether or not he was on a British base, a domestic court should decline so to decide, but should leave the matter to be taken (whether in relation to this or another case) to Strasbourg.\n",
              "The principle here relied upon is that the role of United Kingdom courts, when interpreting the Convention, is to keep in step with Strasbourg neither lagging behind, nor leaping ahead: doing no more, but certainly no less (R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator [2004] UKHL 26; [2004] 2 AC 323, para 20, per Lord Bingham) or no less, but certainly no more (Al Skeini: paras 90 and 106, per Lady Hale and Lord Brown).\n",
              "However, it is our duty to give effect to the domestically enacted Convention rights, while taking account of Strasbourg jurisprudence, although caution is particularly apposite where Strasbourg has decided a case directly in point or, perhaps, where there are mixed messages in the existing Strasbourg case law and, as a result, a real judicial choice to be made there about the scope or application of the Convention.\n",
              "But neither is the case here.\n",
              "Strasbourg has not decided any case directly in point, and both the messages contained in its existing jurisprudence and considerations of general principle seem to me to point in a clear direction.\n",
              "In my judgment the armed forces of a state are, and the European Court of Human Rights would hold that they are, within its jurisdiction, within the meaning of article 1 and for the purposes of article 2 wherever they may be.\n",
              "On that basis, it is incumbent on us under the Human Rights Act 1998, s.6, to give effect to that conclusion.\n",
              "I would dismiss the appeal on the first issue.\n",
              "Issue 2 article 2\n",
              "The second issue is whether the fresh inquest into Private Smiths death must conform with the procedural obligation implied into article 2 of the Convention.\n",
              "In essence: what kind of inquest should the coroner hold, leading to what kind of verdict, in respect of Private Smiths death? Again, since questions of jurisdiction are involved, this issue cannot simply be answered by reference to the Secretary of States concession (para 159 above) that he will not object to the fullest type of inquest and (presumably) verdict.\n",
              "The reference to the procedural obligation implied into article 2 is significant.\n",
              "Article 2 has two aspects; one substantive, the other procedural.\n",
              "The latter is implied in order to make sure that [the former is] effective in practice; and is parasitic upon the existence of the substantive right, and cannot exist independently: R (Gentle) v Prime Minister [2008] UKHL 20; [2008] AC 1356, paras 5 6, per Lord Bingham; and see Jordan v United Kingdom (2001) 37 EHRR 52, para 105 and Edwards v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 487, para 69.\n",
              "In its substantive aspect, article 2 requires states not to take life without justification and also to establish a framework of laws, precautions, procedures and means of enforcement which will, to the greatest extent reasonably practicable, protect life: R (Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner [2004] UKHL 10; [2004] 2 AC 182, para 2 of the opinion of the Appellate Committee given by Lord Bingham.\n",
              "Where there is such an established and appropriate framework, casual errors of judgment or acts of negligence (or operational as opposed to systematic failures) by state servants or agents will not by themselves amount to breach of the substantive obligation inherent in article 2 (a principle established in the context of medical negligence): Powell v United Kingdom (2000) 30 EHRR CD 362, Takoushis v Inner North London Coroner [2005] EyWCA Civ 1440; [2006] 1 WLR 461, paras 51 to 58; Byrzykowski v Poland (2006) 46 EHRR 675, paras 104 106; and Savage v South Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (MIND intervening) [2008] UKHL 74; [2009] AC 681.\n",
              "In its procedural aspect, article 2 requires member states to initiate an effective public investigation by an independent official body into any death occurring in circumstances in which it appears that one or other of the foregoing substantive obligations has been, or may have been, violated and it appears that agents of the state are, or may be, in some way implicated: Middleton, para 3.\n",
              "Thus to make good [a] procedural right to the inquiry which the respondent seeks, she must show at least an arguable case that the substantive right arises on the facts .: Gentle, para 6, per Lord Bingham.\n",
              "The framework of procedures and means of enforcement required under the substantive aspect of article 2 must include, where appropriate, means of civil redress and criminal prosecution.\n",
              "The present focus is however on the procedural aspect of article 2, and on its requirement (based clearly on the potential involvement of the state in the death) for an effective public investigation by an independent official body into certain types of death, that is those occurring in circumstances potentially engaging the substantive right which article 2 contains.\n",
              "English law has long required a coroners inquest in respect of certain types of death.\n",
              "Pending the coming into force of the relevant sections of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, the position is governed by the Coroners Act 1988.\n",
              "Section 8(1) requires a coroner to hold an inquest in respect of any body lying within his district where there is reasonable cause to suspect that the deceased (a) has died a violent or an unnatural death, (b) has died a sudden death of which the cause is unknown or (c) has died in prison (or in a place or circumstances requiring an inquest under any other Act).\n",
              "Section 8(3) requires the coroner to summon a jury, in various cases, including where it appears that (c) applies, or the death occurred while the deceased was in police custody, or resulted from an injury caused by a police officer in the purported execution of his duty or was caused by an accident, poisoning or disease requiring notice under section 19 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, or in circumstances the continuation or possible recurrence of which is prejudicial to public health or safety.\n",
              "Such an inquest is designed to lead to a verdict, certified by an inquisition setting out, so far as such particulars have been proved (i) who the deceased was; and (ii) how, when and where the deceased came by his death: section 11(3) to (5) and rule 36 of the Coroners Rules 1984.\n",
              "There is a clear overlap (particularly when sections 8(1)(c) and 8(3) apply) between the circumstances in which the 1988 Act requires a coroners inquest and those in which the procedural obligation inherent in article 2 arises.\n",
              "But the two do not necessarily coincide.\n",
              "The domestic duty to hold an inquest can quite often arise in circumstances not engaging the procedural obligation under article 2.\n",
              "The procedural obligation inherent in article 2 may be satisfied by other forms of investigation than an inquest, for example a public inquiry or even criminal proceedings.\n",
              "Where the domestic duty to hold an inquest and the procedural obligation inherent in article 2 coincide, the difficulty arose under English law that the coroners duty to seek to ascertain how the deceased came by his death was interpreted as limiting him to considering by what means the deceased died, rather than looking more widely at the circumstances in which this occurred: R v Coroner for North Humberside and Scunthorpe, Ex p Jamieson [1995] QB 1.\n",
              "In Middleton, which concerned the suicide in prison of a long term prisoner, the House of Lords addressed this difficulty, by acknowledging that a broader inquiry was required under article 2, if the investigation was to ensure the proper accountability of state agents for deaths occurring under their responsibility.\n",
              "Accordingly, it held, pursuant to section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, that the word how must in such a context be given the expanded meaning of in what broad circumstances, so as to give effect to the requirements to be read into article 2 of the Convention.\n",
              "The House thus distinguished between a traditional Jamieson inquest and an article 2 compliant Middleton inquest.\n",
              "In R (Hurst) v London Northern District Coroner [2007] UKHL 13; [2007] 2 AC 189, it was argued that Middleton had established the expanded meaning of how for all contexts, including those not engaging article 2, and that the traditional Jamieson inquest had therefore been entirely superseded.\n",
              "The House categorically rejected the argument.\n",
              "The question arose in Hurst was whether it would serve any useful purpose to reopen an inquest.\n",
              "Lady Hale and I took the view that the distinction between the scope of investigation, (rather than verdict) possible in a Jamieson as opposed to a Middleton inquest was not as stark as we understood Lord Brown (with whom Lord Bingham agreed) to be suggesting: compare paras 19 and 23, per Lady Hale and paras 74 76, per Lord Mance, with paras 51 and 56 57, per Lord Brown.\n",
              "I drew attention (para 74) to the possibility of a coroners report to a responsible person or authority under rule 43 of the Coroners Rules 1984.\n",
              "Lord Rodger (to whom I must have been mistaken in referring in para 74) was at pains to stress the distinction in scope at paras 6 7, noting that on the Jamieson approach the allegations of failure by the police to heed prior warnings of hostility on the part of the deceaseds killer towards the deceased would be outside the scope of the wider enquiry that would have been required on a Middleton approach.\n",
              "The potential limitations of the Jamieson approach on the scope of investigation were encapsulated by Sir Thomas Bingham MR in that case, [1995] QB 1, 23G, in a reference to rule 36 of the 1984 Rules as requiring that the proceedings and evidence shall be directed solely to ascertaining the deceaseds identity, the place and time of death and how the deceased came by his death.\n",
              "The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (not yet in force) might appear to perpetuate the distinction by underlining that it is only when necessary under article 2 that the purpose of ascertaining how, when and where the deceased came by his or her death is expanded so as to be read as including the purpose of ascertaining in what circumstances the deceased came by his or her death.\n",
              "It is in these circumstances of relevance that Lord Phillips questions the extent of the distinction, and in particular whether there is any difference in practice between a Jamieson and a Middleton inquest, other than the verdict (paras 69(ii) and 78), and to note that he has on this point the support of Lord Walker (though he also agrees with Lord Rodger on this point) as well as of Lord Collins and Lord Kerr.\n",
              "Lord Hope expressly (para 95) and, as I read him, Lord Rodger implicitly (paras 112 115) see a continuing distinction between the scope of investigation under a Jamieson and a Middleton inquest.\n",
              "For my part, I would have wished to be able to go as far as Lord Phillips, but I do feel some difficulty about questioning whether there is in practice any real distinction at all (save in the verdict expressed), having regard to Hurst and the 2009 Act and also having regard to my relative ignorance as to the extent to which such a distinction between the two types of inquest is in fact meaningful in day to day practice (as the courts in Jamieson, Middleton and Hurst must on the face of it have thought).\n",
              "However, it seems unnecessary on this appeal to pursue this aspect further.\n",
              "Everyone agrees that coroners have a considerable discretion as to the scope of their enquiry, although the verdict that they may deliver differs according to the type of inquest being held.\n",
              "The practical solution is no doubt for coroners to be alert to the possibility that a Middleton type verdict may be, or become, necessary, and to be ready to adapt the scope of their investigation accordingly.\n",
              "In the present case, the coroner (whose verdict has been set aside on different grounds) concluded that, on the facts as he saw them in the first inquest, a traditional Jamieson type of inquest was all that was required.\n",
              "Collins J and the Court of Appeal disagreed.\n",
              "They concluded that a Middleton type inquest was required.\n",
              "The Court of Appeals reasoning was that Private Smith was in a position analogous to that of a prisoner, a person detained on mental or other grounds or a conscript, and that a Middleton type inquest was required in respect of any death of such a person in prison or custody or while serving in the army.\n",
              "The Secretary of State appeals to the Supreme Court against the Court of Appeals reasoning and conclusion.\n",
              "The states procedural duty under article 2 to provide for or ensure an effective public investigation by an independent official body of certain deaths or near deaths has been developed in the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and explored in domestic case law, including that of the House of Lords in R (Amin) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] UKHL 51; [2004] 1 AC 653, Middleton (above) and R (L(A Patient)) v Secretary of State for Justice [2008] UKHL 68; [2009] AC 588.\n",
              "Certain categories of case in which the substantive right contained in article 2 has been held to be potentially engaged, with the result that the procedural obligation has been held to exist, are clearly recognisable: (i) Killings by state agents: McCann v United Kingdom (1995) 21 EHHR 97, para 161 (article 2 requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force by, inter alios, agents of the State\") and Jordan v United Kingdom (2001) 37 EHRR 52; and see Amin, paras 20 and 25, per Lord Bingham. (ii) Deaths in custody: Salman v Turkey (2000) 34 EHHR 425, esp para 99 (unexplained death in custody, because persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them); Edwards v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 487 (violent death of a prisoner at the hands of his cell mate); Akdogdu v Turkey (Application No 46747/99), 18 October 2005, (suicide in prison); R (D) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWHC 728 (Admin); [2006] EWCA Civ 143, considered by the House of Lords in L (a case of suicide in prison). (iii) Conscripts: lvarez Ramn v Spain (Application No 51192/99), 3 July 2001; Kilin v Turkey (Application No 40145/98),7 June 2005; Savage v South East Essex NHS Foundation Trust (MIND intervening) [2008] UKHL 74; [2009] AC 681, paras 35 37, per Lord Rodger. (iv) Mental health detainees: Savage although concerned not with any duty to investigate under article 2, but with responsibility in a claim for damages for the suicide of a mental health detainee who succeeded in absconding and committed suicide highlights the analogy between the states duties (v) towards persons in custody and persons in detention for mental health reasons as well as conscripts.\n",
              "Other situations where the State has a positive substantive obligation to take steps to safeguard life.\n",
              "Such situations exist not only where the right to life is inherently at risk, but also where the State is on notice of a specific threat to someones life against which protective steps could be taken: Osman v United Kingdom (1998) 29 EHRR 245; neryildiz v Turkey (2004) 41 EHRR 325 (state allegedly tolerated and, for political reasons, encouraged slum settlements close to a huge uncontrolled rubbish tip, without making any effort to inform the settlers of dangers posed by the tip, which in the event exploded, killing some 39 residents).\n",
              "In neryildiz the Court said that, where lives had actually been lost in circumstances potentially engaging the responsibility of the State, the procedural aspect of article 2 entailed a further duty on the State to ensure an adequate response judicial or otherwise so that the legislative and administrative framework set up to protect the right to life is properly implemented and any breaches of that right are repressed and punished (para 91), and that the applicable principles are rather to be found in those the Court has already had occasion to develop in relation notably to the use of lethal force, principles which lend themselves to application in other categories of cases (para 93, italics added for emphasis).\n",
              "The Court explained that, just as in homicide cases the true circumstances of the death often in practice were, or might be, largely confined within the knowledge of state officials or authorities, so in its view such considerations are indisputably valid in the context of dangerous activities, when lives have been lost as a result of events occurring under the responsibility of the public authorities, which are often the only entities to have sufficient relevant knowledge to identify and establish the complex phenomena that might have caused such incidents (para 93).\n",
              "It added that: the requirements of article 2 go beyond the state of official investigation, where this has led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts: the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirements of the positive obligation to protect lives through the law (para 95).\n",
              "In neryildiz itself, it was not the preliminary investigation following the tragedy that was at fault, but rather the operation of the judicial system in response to the tragedy and investigation: paras 96, 115, 117 118 and 150 155.\n",
              "The procedural obligation incumbent on the state to investigate deaths which, either of their inherent nature or in their particular circumstances, involve the states potential responsibility under article 2 may be distinguished from the general substantive obligation under article 2 to establish an appropriate regulatory, investigatory and judicial system.\n",
              "The distinction was drawn clearly in respect of a third party killing in Menson v United Kingdom (2003) 37 EHRR CD 220.\n",
              "The Court there said: The Court observes that the applicants have not laid any blame on the authorities of the respondent State for the actual death of Michael Menson; nor has it been suggested that the authorities knew or ought to have known that Michael Menson was at risk of physical violence at the hands of third parties and failed to take appropriate measures to safeguard him against that risk.\n",
              "The applicants case is therefore to be distinguished from cases involving the alleged use of lethal force either by agents of the State or by private parties with their collusion (see, for example, McCann v United Kingdom (1995) [21 EHRR 97]; Jordan v United Kingdom (2001) [37 EHRR 52]; Shanaghan v United Kingdom, (Application No 37715/97), judgment of 4 May 2001, ECHR 2001 III (extracts), or in which the factual circumstances imposed an obligation on the authorities to protect an individuals life, for example where they have assumed responsibility for his welfare (see, for example, Edwards v United Kingdom (2002) [35 EHRR 487]), or where they knew or ought to have known that his life was at risk (see, for example, Osman v United Kingdom (1998) [29 EHRR 245].\n",
              "The Court went on: However, the absence of any direct state responsibility for the death of Michael Menson does not exclude the applicability of article 2.\n",
              "It recalls that by requiring a State to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction (see LCB v United Kingdom (1998) [27 EHRR 212], para 36), article 2 para 1 imposes a duty on that state to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions (see Osman, cited above, para 115).\n",
              "With reference to the facts of the instant case, the Court considers that this obligation requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when there is reason to believe that an individual has sustained life threatening injuries in suspicious circumstances.\n",
              "The investigation must be capable of establishing the cause of the injuries and the identification of those responsible with a view to their punishment.\n",
              "Where death results, as in Michael Mensons case, the investigation assumes even greater importance, having regard to the fact that the essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life (see mutatis mutandis, the Edwards judgment, above cited, para 69).\n",
              "Analysis: Both the substantive and the procedural limbs of article 2 are therefore capable of giving rise to obligations of investigation on the part of state authorities, including the courts.\n",
              "The present appeal concerns the circumstances in which article 2 gives rise to a particular procedural obligation on the part of the state of its own motion to initiate an effective public investigation by an independent official body following a death or near death.\n",
              "This in turn depends upon whether the circumstances involve a potential breach of the substantive obligation which article 2 contains.\n",
              "The questions are how general is this obligation and whether it was potentially engaged by the circumstances giving rise to Private Smiths sad death.\n",
              "The present case: The Court of Appeal treated Private Smiths death as analogous to the killing or suicide of a prisoner, detainee or conscript.\n",
              "It said (para 105): The question is therefore whether the principles apply to soldiers on active service in Iraq.\n",
              "We conclude that they do.\n",
              "They are under the control of and subject to army discipline.\n",
              "They must do what the army requires them to do.\n",
              "If the army sends them out into the desert they must go.\n",
              "In this respect they are in the same position as a conscript.\n",
              "Once they have signed up for a particular period they can no more disobey an order than a conscript can.\n",
              "The army owes them the same duty of care at common law.\n",
              "We recognise that they may not be quite as vulnerable as conscripts but they may well be vulnerable in much the same way, both in stressful situations caused by conflict and in stressful situations caused, as in Private Smith's case, by extreme heat.\n",
              "We see no reason why they should not have the same protection as is afforded by article 2 to a conscript.\n",
              "The scope of this reasoning is uncertain.\n",
              "It is unclear in particular whether the Court of Appeal was suggesting that all deaths of military personnel in service require to be investigated by a Middleton type inquiry.\n",
              "Certainly, it was the respondents submission before the Supreme Court that all soldiers deaths on active service must be regarded as being potentially the states responsibility, because of the degree of control in a closed system, and, therefore, as requiring full investigation by a Middleton type inquiry.\n",
              "In my judgment, that submission goes too far.\n",
              "Death on military service was an everyday risk in the environment of Iraq, as it is today in Afghanistan.\n",
              "Military service against hostile forces in a harsh environment is a situation par excellence where soldiers lives are likely to be lost without their employing state having even potential responsibility.\n",
              "I do not think that courts should subscribe to a view that all military service involves lions led by donkeys (Alan Clarks words in his 1961 work, The Donkeys: a History of the British Expeditionary Force in 1915, the inspiration for Joan Littlewoods Oh, What a Lovely War!).\n",
              "That may or may not have been a fair description of Earl Haigs strategy in the First World War.\n",
              "But, whatever debate may arise about the adequacy of equipment or funding for the armed forces in todays world, I do not think that it should open on an assumption that modern generals or modern ministers of defence are necessarily or even potentially in breach of their article 2 duties.\n",
              "There needs to be something more than that.\n",
              "The European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence summarised in para 210 above, is focused on deaths where, because of the nature or context (whether general or specific) of the death, the state can, without more, be said realistically to have some form of responsibility and in particular where it may alone have sufficient relevant knowledge to identify and establish the cause of the death or near death.\n",
              "Whether it can be said that such responsibility potentially exists in other cases depends upon their particular circumstances.\n",
              "The significance of a state having exclusive knowledge of the relevant events appears to be that this tends to open up a possibility of state involvement and a corresponding need for public investigation to exclude or establish that possibility.\n",
              "Nothing in the case law, and nothing in principle, establishes or indicates that the duty extends to every death of every soldier on active service.\n",
              "There are two particular differences between the present case and any situation previously considered.\n",
              "First, the present case concerns a volunteer Territorial Army soldier, who, the Supreme Court was told, would also have volunteered to go to Iraq (before, then, being served with compulsory call up papers to protect his position, presumably in respect of such matters as employment).\n",
              "I accept that a person who volunteers for active service puts himself or herself in a position where he or she is under extreme discipline, bound to obey orders in a harsh physical environment, the concomitant being that the army authorities must protect him or her against risks potentially arising from obeying such orders.\n",
              "But it does not follow that every death by heatstroke engages, without more, the states potential responsibility.\n",
              "Second, the case concerns death, not by killing, suicide or violence, but by heat associated with the admittedly harsh physical environment in which Private Smith was placed.\n",
              "It was incumbent on the army authorities to address the risks of heat in active service in Iraq, and put adequate systems in place to meet them.\n",
              "But, again, not every death by heat on active service in Iraq can or should be treated without more as involving a potential failure by the state to fulfil that responsibility or a defective system of protection, or therefore, in my view, as requiring the same level of scrutiny and investigation as a death by killing or suicide of a person in custody or a conscript.\n",
              "Some further examination of the particular facts is called for, before such a conclusion.\n",
              "Conclusion on issue 2\n",
              "In my view, therefore, the coroners general approach was correct.\n",
              "Only if there were sufficient indicia of such a failure or deficiency was it incumbent on the state of its own motion to ensure an effective public investigation by an independent official body, and incumbent therefore on the coroner to expand the inquest to become a Middleton type inquest.\n",
              "The coroner in the first inquest (whose inquisition has now been set aside) concluded that there were insufficient indicia.\n",
              "Death resulting from negligence by members of the armed forces in the application of an established and appropriate system of protection is not axiomatically to be equated with state responsibility for the death under article 2: see para 215 above.\n",
              "But the sequence of events set out in Mrs Smiths case (paras 4 to 35), including the coroners own recommendations after giving judgment, are suggestive of systematic rather than simply operational errors and persuade me that there is here a sufficient case of state responsibility for Private Smiths death for us to be able to rule now that the fresh inquest should be of the Middleton type.\n",
              "The Secretary of States agreement serves merely to confirm the appropriateness of this on the particular facts.\n",
              "I would therefore answer the second issue (identified in para 200 above) affirmatively.\n",
              "It also follows that I would maintain the declaration contained in para 1 of Collins Js Order dated 12 May 2008 (deleting only its final words as set out in the Courts judgment, since it is the judgments in this Court that will now be determinative).\n",

              "As the Court of Appeal recognised, the question of jurisdiction under article 1 on this appeal is academic.\n",
              "After Private Smith collapsed in the stadium where he was billeted, he was taken by ambulance to the medical centre at the camp, where he died of heatstroke.\n",
              "The Secretary of State conceded that the relevant circumstances leading to Private Smiths death took place within the geographical area of a British army camp and a British army hospital, and that a soldier who dies on a United Kingdom base dies within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention: [2008] 3 WLR 1284, at [7] (Collins J); [2009] 3 WLR 1099, at [8], [14] (CA).\n",
              "These concessions flowed from the decision of the House of Lords in R (Al Skeini) v Secretary of State for Defence [2007] UKHL 26, [2008] AC 153 (see [6], [61], [132] for the concessions) that the Secretary of State was right to concede the correctness of the Divisional Courts reasoning that Mr Mousas death in a British military detention centre in Iraq was within the scope of the Convention because the camp was to be assimilated to exceptional cases of extraterritoriality such as embassies and consulates: [2007] QB 140, at [287] (Div Ct).\n",
              "Nevertheless the Court of Appeal decided to hear argument on, and rule upon, the question whether a British soldier in the Territorial Army, who is on military service in Iraq, is subject to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention, so as to benefit from the rights guaranteed by the Human Rights Act 1998, while operating in Iraq, or whether he is only subject to the jurisdiction for those purposes when he is on a British military base or in a British hospital.\n",
              "The reason why the Court of Appeal took this course is that Collins J had decided the broader question, and because both the Secretary of State and the Equality and Human Rights Commission had characterised the question as being of great general significance or importance.\n",
              "The question is plainly one of importance, but it is unfortunate that it has been decided in the courts below, and will be decided in this court, in a case in which the point does not arise for decision and in which it is conceded to be academic.\n",

              "That is particularly so in the present case.\n",
              "In some of the cases on article 1 the Strasbourg court has considered relevant the degree of control or authority exercised by the respondent state in the foreign territory and the existence of the consent of the territorial state to the exercise of authority by the respondent state: see eg Loizidou v Turkey (Preliminary Objections) (1995) 20 EHRR 99, at [62]; Bankovi v Belgium (2001) 11 BHRC 435, at [60], [71]; calan v Turkey (2003) 37 EHRR 238, at [93]; (2005) 41 EHRR 985, at [91]; Issa v Turkey (2004) 41 EHRR 567, at [69]; Al Saadoon and Mufdhi v United Kingdom (admissibility) (2009) 49 EHRR SE 95, at [85].\n",

              "It has been said that when the Government reaches out to punish a citizen who is abroad, the shield which the Bill of Rights and other parts of the Constitution provide to protect his life and liberty should not be stripped away just because he happens to be in another land: Reid v Covert, 354 US 1, 6 (1957), per Black J, for a plurality of four justices (military court tried and convicted the wife of a US air force sergeant for the murder of her husband at an air base in England: entitled to a jury trial as required by the Sixth Amendment).\n",

              "Not every use of the expression jurisdiction in international law is co terminous with that in article 1.\n",
              "For example, a state may exercise jurisdiction over its nationals abroad in the sense that it may prescribe rules of law in relation to its nationals abroad: Restatement (Third), Foreign Relations Law of the United States, 1987, section 402; Oppenheim, International Law, 9th ed Jennings and Watts, 1992, vol 1, para 138; Higgins, ante, vol 2, p 802.\n",

              "Armed forces of the United Kingdom serving abroad are subject to military law and discipline, they owe allegiance to the Crown, and where they are stationed abroad with the consent of the local sovereign, the arrangements with that sovereign will normally provide for immunity (at least in certain respects) from the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the host state: for the immunity of United States armed forces in the United Kingdom see Littrell v United States of America (No 2) [1995] 1 WLR 82 (CA); Holland v Lampen Wolfe [2000] 1 WLR 1573 (HL).\n",
              "In that sense there can be no doubt that armed forces serving abroad are subject to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, or as Lord Bingham put it in R (Gentle) v Prime Minister [2008] UKHL 20, [2008] AC 1356, [8(3)], subject to the authority of the United Kingdom.\n",
              "The international practice is confirmed by CPA Order No 17, under which all coalition personnel were expressed to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of their Sending States(section 2(3)) and immune from legal process and arrest or detention (section 2(1), (3)).\n",

              "What is jurisdiction in international law? According to Oppenheim, International Law, 9th ed Jennings and Watts, 1992, vol 1, p 456: State jurisdiction concerns essentially the extent of each states right to regulate conduct or the consequences of events.\n",
              "In practice jurisdiction is not a single concept.\n",
              "A states jurisdiction may take various forms.\n",
              "Thus a state may regulate conduct by legislation; or it may, through its courts, regulate those differences which come before them, whether arising out of the civil or criminal law; or it may regulate conduct by taking executive or administrative action which impinges more directly on the course of events, as by enforcing its laws or the decisions of its courts.\n",
              "The extent of the states jurisdiction may differ in each of these contexts.\n",
              "The Restatement (Third), Foreign Relations Law of the United States (1987) vol 1, p 230, uses jurisdiction to mean the authority of states to prescribe their law, to subject persons and things to adjudication in their courts and other tribunals, and to enforce their law, both judicially and non judicially.\n",
              "These different aspects of jurisdiction are sometimes said to be curial or judicial jurisdiction, legislative jurisdiction, and enforcement jurisdiction.\n",
              "Curial jurisdiction is essentially concerned with the ability of courts to exercise jurisdiction in civil matters over foreigners.\n",
              "Legislative jurisdiction is about the ability of states to use their own laws to regulate or punish acts in foreign countries.\n",
              "The question in international law is whether states have a legitimate interest in, or sufficient connection with, acts committed abroad so as to justify the application of their laws to them.\n",
              "In the famous Lotus case (France v Turkey), (1927) PCIJ, Series A, No.10, p 4, the Permanent Court of International Justice said (at 19): Far from laying down a general prohibition to the effect that states may not extend the application of their laws . to persons, property and acts outside their territory, it leaves them in this respect a wide measure of discretion which is only limited in certain cases by\n",
              "prohibitive rules\n",
              "International controversies over the extra territorial application of criminal or penal laws, such as anti trust or securities laws, are about the limits of legislative jurisdiction: see Morrison v National Australia Bank Ltd, United States Supreme Court, June 24, 2010.\n",
              "That is no doubt why, as will appear below, the Strasbourg court referred in Bankovi v Belgium (2001) 11 BHRC 435, [59], in the context of the words within their jurisdiction in article 1 of the Convention to the bases of jurisdiction to prescribe criminal offences for conduct abroad.\n",
              "As for enforcement jurisdiction, in the Lotus case (France v Turkey), the Permanent Court said (at 18 19): Now the first and foremost restriction imposed by international law upon a state is that failing the existence of a permissive rule to the contrary it may not exercise its power in any form in the territory of another state.\n",
              "In this sense jurisdiction is certainly territorial; it cannot be exercised by a state outside its territory except by virtue of a permissive rule derived from international custom or from a convention.\n",
              "That is a statement about enforcement jurisdiction, namely the limits of the right of a state to act on the territory of another state or to take measures on its own territory which require compliance in another state.\n",
              "Thus a state cannot, without the consent of the territorial sovereign, perform official acts in a foreign state or carry out official investigations in the foreign state.\n",
              "The inability of a foreign state to claim, directly or indirectly, its taxes in England is sometimes put on the basis that it is an illegitimate extension of its territorial jurisdiction: see Government of India v Taylor [1955] AC 491.\n",
              "The issue on this part of the appeal\n",
              "On this part of the appeal the issue is whether the undoubted jurisdiction which states has over their armed forces abroad means that their soldiers are within their jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "The obvious starting point is that the operation of the Convention is territorial, and that its extra territorial application is exceptional.\n",
              "The Strasbourg court has recognised few exceptions, and it is not easy to extract a common principled basis for them.\n",
              "The main questions which arise are (1) whether armed forces can be brought within article 1 simply on the basis that in international law they are subject to the jurisdiction of the state which they serve; or (2) whether they are within article 1 because of the authority and control which the state exercises over them; (3) whether they are within article 1 because there is a jurisdictional link between them and the state.\n",
              "In order that these questions may be considered it is necessary to consider Bankovi v Belgium (2001) 11 BHRC 435 and its antecedents, and some of the subsequent Strasbourg cases considered in Al Skeini, and finally cases decided in Strasbourg after Al Skeini.\n",
              "Early cases\n",
              "At the risk of repeating some of what has been said in other cases about the antecedents of Bankovi v Belgium (2001) 11 BHRC 435, it is important to consider what was decided by the Strasbourg court in Bankovi in December 2001 against the background of decisions of the Commission and the Court on the scope of jurisdiction under article 1 stretching over 35 years.\n",
              "In Soering v United Kingdom (1989) 11 EHRR 439, at [86], the Court, in plenary session, had referred to the limit on the reach of the Convention under article 1 as being notably territorial.\n",
              "One line of decisions suggested that a state would be responsible for acts of its officials (especially diplomatic and consular officials) performed abroad in performance of their duties to nationals: X v Germany (1965) 8 Yb ECHR 158 (Commission).\n",
              "Similar statements in Cyprus v Turkey (1975) 2 DR 125, at [8] and Hess v United Kingdom (1975) 2 DR 72 fall within this category also, and are not based, as they could have been (and, in the case of Cyprus, later were), on control of territory in Northern Cyprus in the former decision, or on Spandau prison being an extension of the territory of the occupying powers.\n",
              "It is likely that the emphasis on diplomats and consuls in the early decisions reflected the fiction of the extra territoriality of diplomatic premises.\n",
              "There is, however, no actual decision (as distinct from dicta) either of the Commission or of the Court which assimilates diplomatic or consular premises to the territory of the sending state.\n",
              "So also Cyprus v Turkey (1975) 2 DR 125, at [8] assumed an extended notion of territoriality in relation to ships and aircraft registered in a Convention state.\n",
              "Another line of Commission decisions expressed the thought that the expression within their jurisdiction was not equivalent to or limited to the national territory of the contracting state concerned, and extended to all persons under their actual authority and responsibility, whether that authority is exercised within their own territory or abroad : Cyprus v Turkey (1975) 2 DR 125, at [8].\n",
              "See also X & Y v Switzerland (1977) 2 DR 57; M v Denmark (1992) 73 DR 193.\n",
              "These strands, acts by officials affecting persons, or officials exercising authority over persons, were brought together in X v United Kingdom, (Application No 7547/76) (1977) 12 DR 73.\n",
              "This was a child abduction case in which a Jordanian married to a British woman took their daughter to Jordan.\n",
              "The complaint was that the British consulate in Amman had not done enough to obtain the custody of her daughter following a custody order by the English court.\n",
              "The Commission was satisfied that the consular authorities had done all that could be reasonably expected of them.\n",
              "The Commission said, on jurisdiction, that it was clear from the constant jurisprudence of the Commission that authorised agents of a state, including diplomatic or consular agents, brought other persons or property within the jurisdiction of that state to the extent that they exercised authority over such persons or property.\n",
              "Insofar as they affected such persons or property by their acts or omissions, the responsibility of the state was engaged.\n",
              "Therefore even though the alleged failure of the consular authorities to do all in their power to help the applicant occurred outside the territory of the United Kingdom, it was still within [the] jurisdiction within the meaning of article 1.\n",
              "It should be noted that this formulation by the Commission is inconsistent with the text of article 1, which is about persons within the jurisdiction, and not about acts or omissions within the jurisdiction.\n",
              "The decision of the Court in plenary session in Drozd and Janousek v France and Spain (1992) 14 EHRR 745 must be read against the background of the previous cases.\n",

              "The applicants were Spanish and Czech citizens, who had been convicted of armed robbery and complained that they had not had a fair trial.\n",
              "The Court agreed with the respondent states that the judges did not sit in their capacity as French or Spanish judges, and their judgments were not subject to supervision by the authorities of France or Spain.\n",
              "It does not seem to have been disputed by France and Spain that, if the judges had sat in their capacity as French or Spanish judges, the jurisdictional test of article 1 would have been satisfied.\n",
              "The way in which the Court put it was that France and Spain would be responsible because of acts of their authorities producing effects outside their own territory. (at [91], citing most of the cases mentioned above).\n",

              "The final strand in the authorities prior to Bankovi is represented by the notion that effective control of territory abroad is equivalent to jurisdiction over that territory.\n",
              "In Loizidou v Turkey (Preliminary Objections) (1995) 20 EHRR 99, the Court (reflecting Cyprus v Turkey (1975) 2 DR 125, at [8]) held (at [62]) that the responsibility of a Contracting Party may also arise when as a consequence of military action whether lawful or unlawful it exercises effective control of an area outside its national territory.\n",
              "The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention, derives from the fact of such control whether it be exercised directly, through its armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration.\n",
              "The concept of control is also taken up in other Northern Cyprus cases: e.g. Loizidou v Turkey (Merits) (1996) 23 EHRR 513, at [52]; Cyprus v Turkey (2001) 35 EHRR 731, at [77].\n",
              "Prior to Bankovi, the Court had also declared admissible complaints against Turkey (a) arising out of operations of its armed forces in Northern Iraq which were alleged to have resulted in violations of the Convention, including the death and torture of some villagers (Issa v Turkey, Application No 31821/96, 30 May 2000, unreported); and (b) arising out of the arrest by Turkish security officers of the applicant, the leader of the PKK, at Nairobi airport with the consent of the Kenyan authorities, and his subsequent removal to, and trial in Turkey (calan v Turkey, (Application No 46221/99), 14 December 2000, unreported).\n",

              "The concessions by the respondent states\n",
              "The prior decisions go some way to explaining why the respondent states made a number of concessions in Bankovi, not all of which found their way into the reasoning of the Court.\n",
              "They accepted that (a) the exercise of jurisdiction involved the assertion or exercise of legal authority, actual or purported, over persons owing some form of allegiance to the state or who had been brought within that states control, and that the term jurisdiction generally entailed some form of structured relationship normally existing over a period of time (judgment of the Court at [36]); (b) the Court had applied that notion of jurisdiction to confirm that individuals affected by acts of a state outside its territory could be considered to fall within its jurisdiction because there was an exercise of some form of legal authority by the state over them (at [37]); (c) the arrest and detention of the applicants in Issa v Turkey and calan v Turkey constituted a classic exercise of such legal authority or jurisdiction over those persons by military forces on foreign soil (ibid).\n",
              "The issue\n",
              "The issue in Bankovi, stated in para [54] of the decision of the Grand Chamber by reference to the decisions in Drozd and the cases involving Northern Cyprus, was whether the fact that the acts of the respondent states were performed or had effects outside the territory of the contracting states meant that the applicants were capable of falling within the jurisdiction of the respondent states.\n",
              "The concept of jurisdiction in the Courts decision\n",
              "For present purposes, the relevant points which emerge from Bankovi are these: (1) the jurisdictional competence of a state is primarily territorial; (2) international law does not exclude a states exercise of jurisdiction extra territorially, but the bases of such jurisdiction (including nationality, flag, diplomatic and consular relations, effect, protection, passive personality and universality) are as a general rule defined and limited by the sovereign territorial rights of other states; (3) the competence of a state to exercise jurisdiction over its own nationals abroad is subordinate to the territorial competence of that state and other states; (4) a state may not exercise jurisdiction on the territory of another without the consent of the latter unless it is an occupying state, in which case it may exercise jurisdiction in certain respects; (5) article 1 of the Convention reflects the ordinary and essentially territorial notion of jurisdiction; (6) other bases of jurisdiction are exceptional and require special justification in the particular circumstances of each case; (7) article 1 is not to be treated as part of the living instruments provisions, and the travaux confirmed the ordinary meaning of article 1.\n",
              "It should be noted that the Court nowhere explains what it understands by the expression jurisdiction in the context of article 1.\n",
              "The reference in para [59] to extraterritorial jurisdiction as including nationality, flag, diplomatic and consular relations, effect, protection, passive personality and universality is a mixture of two entirely different concepts of extra territoriality.\n",
              "The first (nationality, flag, diplomatic and consular relations) reflects the fiction of the extra territoriality of ships and aircraft and diplomatic and consular premises.\n",
              "The second (effect, protection, passive personality and universality) represents the generally accepted exceptions to the territorial nature of criminal jurisdiction, that is, the exceptions to the principle that a state cannot use its criminal courts to punish persons for acts committed abroad.\n",
              "The first aspect can be illustrated by the way it is put in the last edition of Oppenheim edited by Sir Hersch Lauterpacht, 8th ed (1955), pp 461, 793): In contradistinction to these real parts of State territory there are some things that are either in every respect or for some purposes treated as though they were territorial parts of a State.\n",
              "They are fictional and in a sense only parts of the territory.\n",
              "Thus men of war and other public vessels on the high seas as well as in foreign territorial waters are essentially in every point treated as though they were floating parts of their home State.\n",
              "The premises in which foreign diplomatic envoys have their official residence are in many respects treated as though they were parts of the home States of the envoys concerned.\n",
              "Again merchantmen on the high seas are in certain respects treated as though they were floating parts of the territory of the State under whose flag they legitimately sail.\n",
              "Extraterritoriality, in this as in every other case, is a fiction only, for diplomatic envoys are in reality not without, but within, the territories of the receiving States.\n",
              "The term extraterritoriality is nevertheless valuable because it demonstrates clearly the fact that envoys must, in most respects, be treated as though they were not within the territory of the receiving States.\n",
              "The so called extraterritoriality of envoys takes practical form in a body of privileges which must be severally discussed.\n",
              "The second aspect of jurisdiction, reflected in the Courts reference to effect, protection, passive personality and universality is that which has much exercised international lawyers (but which has nothing to do with the issue under article 1), namely the extent to which states can exercise criminal jurisdiction in respect of acts committed outside their national territory.\n",
              "In the Lotus case the Permanent Court said (at 20): Though it is true that in all systems of law the principle of the territorial character of criminal law is fundamental, it is equally true that all or nearly all these systems of law extend their action to offences committed outside the territory of the State which adopts them, and they do so in ways which vary from State to State.\n",
              "The territoriality of criminal law, therefore, is not an absolute principle of international law and by no means coincides with territorial sovereignty.\n",
              "Consequently it is well accepted that there are well established exceptions to the territorial principle, and they are reflected in the reference in Bankovi at [59] to effect (normally referred to as effects), protection, passive personality and universality.\n",
              "The exceptions normally articulated are these: first, the nationality principle by which a state has jurisdiction over crimes committed by its nationals abroad; second, the so called protective principle under which states claim jurisdiction over acts committed by aliens abroad which threaten the state; third, the passive personality basis of jurisdiction under which a state may exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed abroad by aliens if the victim is a national of the state claiming jurisdiction; fourth, the controversial effects doctrine where jurisdiction is taken over an offence which is committed abroad, but which has economic effects in the forum state (such as violations of anti trust laws or securities laws), and which is sometimes said to be an aspect of the so called objective territorial principle, jurisdiction over an offence committed outside the state but concluded or consummated within the territory; fifth, the principle of universal jurisdiction, the oldest example being jurisdiction to try pirates, and now frequently invoked in relation to jurisdiction over war crimes.\n",
              "See Jennings, Extraterritorial Jurisdiction and United States Anti Trust Laws (1957) 32 BYIL 146.\n",
              "It has to be said that neither Bankovi nor a case such as the present has anything to do with extra territorial jurisdiction in these two senses.\n",
              "The question here is whether armed forces serving abroad are within the jurisdiction of the contracting states in a quite different sense, namely whether the fact that they are subject to the military law and discipline of the United Kingdom, and generally not subject to the local law, results in their being within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for article 1 purposes.\n",
              "The exceptional cases\n",
              "The Court went out of its way in Bankovi to emphasise the exceptional nature of the cases in which a state could be responsible for acts or omissions outside its national territory.\n",
              "First, it expressed the view that article 1 of the Convention must be considered to reflect [the] ordinary and essentially territorial notion of jurisdiction, other bases of jurisdiction being exceptional and requiring special justification in the particular circumstances of each case (at [61]).\n",
              "Second, it said (at [67]): In keeping with the essentially territorial notion of jurisdiction, the Court has accepted only in exceptional cases that acts of the contracting states performed, or producing effects, outside their territories can constitute an exercise of jurisdiction by them within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "Third, it emphasised (at [71]): In sum, the case law of the Court demonstrates that its recognition of the exercise of extra territorial jurisdiction by a contracting state is\n",
              "exceptional\n",
              "The Courts treatment of the exceptional cases where acts of contracting states performed, or producing effects, outside their territories could constitute an exercise of jurisdiction within the meaning of article 1 may be summarised in this way.\n",
              "The Soering v United Kingdom line of cases is not concerned with the extra territorial exercise of jurisdiction, because liability is incurred in such cases by the action of a state concerning a person while he or she was on its territory and clearly within its jurisdiction: [68].\n",
              "The exceptions which the Court recognises are these.\n",
              "First, the responsibility of contracting states could in principle be engaged because of acts of their authorities which produced effects or were performed outside their own territory, at [69], citing the Drozd case.\n",
              "Second, the responsibility of a contracting state is capable of being engaged when as a consequence of military action (lawful or unlawful) it exercises effective control of an area outside its national territory as a consequence of military operation or through the consent, invitation or acquiescence of the Government of that territory, and exercises all or some of the public powers normally to be exercised by that Government: at [70], citing Loizidou v Turkey (Preliminary Objections) and Cyprus v Turkey (2001) 35 EHRR 731.\n",
              "These cases were explained on this basis that the respondent state, through the effective control of the relevant territory and its inhabitants abroad as a consequence of military occupation or through the consent, invitation or acquiescence of the Government of that territory, exercises all or some of the public powers normally to be exercised by that Government (at [71]).\n",
              "Third (reflecting the fictional extra territoriality of diplomatic and consular premises and of ships and aircraft) other recognised instances of the extra territorial exercise of jurisdiction by a state include cases involving the activities of its diplomatic or consular agents abroad and on board craft and vessels registered in, or flying the flag of, that state and in these specific situations, customary international law and treaty provisions have recognised the extra territorial exercise of jurisdiction by the relevant state (at [73]).\n",
              "In applying these principles to the facts the Court rejected the suggestion that anyone adversely affected by an act imputable to a contracting state, wherever in the world that act may have been committed or its consequences felt, was thereby brought within the jurisdiction of that state for the purpose of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "The applicants had accepted that jurisdiction, and any consequent state Convention responsibility, would be limited in the circumstances to the commission and consequences of that particular act.\n",
              "But the Court was of the view that the wording of article 1 [did] not provide any support for the applicants suggestion that the positive obligation in article 1 to secure the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention can be divided and tailored in accordance with the particular circumstances of the extra territorial act in question (at [75]).\n",
              "In answer to the argument that failure to recognise the claim of the applicants would leave a vacuum in the Convention system, the Court said (at [80]): The Courts obligation, in this respect, is to have regard to the special character of the Convention as a constitutional instrument of European public order for the protection of individual human beings and its role, as set out in article 19 of the Convention, is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties It is therefore difficult to contend that a failure to accept the extra territorial jurisdiction of the respondent States would fall foul of the Conventions ordre public objective, which itself underlines the essentially regional vocation of the Convention system In short, the Convention is a multi lateral treaty operating, subject to article 56 of the Convention, in an essentially regional context and notably in the legal space (espace juridique) of the Contracting States.\n",
              "The Convention was not designed to be applied throughout the world, even in respect of the conduct of Contracting States.\n",
              "Accordingly, the desirability of avoiding a gap or vacuum in human rights protection has so far been relied on by the Court in favour of establishing jurisdiction only when the territory in question was one that, but for the specific circumstances, would normally be covered by the Convention.[Emphasis in original text].\n",
              "The Court said (at [80]) that Cyprus v Turkey (2001) 35 EHRR 731 related to an entirely different situation: the inhabitants of northern Cyprus would have found themselves excluded from the benefits of the Convention safeguards and system which they had previously enjoyed, by Turkeys effective control of the territory and by the accompanying inability of the Cypriot Government, as a contracting state, to fulfil the obligations it had undertaken under the Convention.\n",
              "The Court did not deal expressly with the applicability of the exception it had identified by reference to Drozd, namely that the responsibility of contracting states could in principle be engaged because of acts of their authorities which produced effects or were performed outside their own territory.\n",
              "But it did deal with the applicants reliance on the admissibility decisions in Issa v Turkey and calan v Turkey.\n",
              "In each of those cases the Court had held admissible complaints relating to Turkeys conduct in non contracting states, Iraq in the former case and Kenya in the latter case.\n",
              "All that the Court said about those cases was this (at [81]): It is true that the Court has declared both of these cases admissible and that they include certain complaints about alleged actions by Turkish agents outside Turkish territory.\n",
              "However, in neither of those cases was the issue of jurisdiction raised by the respondent Government or addressed in the admissibility decisions and in any event the merits of those cases remain to be decided.\n",
              "The conclusion of the Court (at [82]) was that there was no jurisdictional link between the persons who were victims of the act complained of and the respondent states.\n",
              "The subsequent decisions\n",
              "The exceptional nature of any liability for extra territorial acts or omissions articulated in Bankovi has been repeatedly quoted or re stated by the Court: calan v Turkey (2003) 37 EHRR 238, at [93]; Assanidze v Georgia (2004) 39 EHRR 653, at [137]; Ilacu v Moldova and Russia (2005) 40 EHRR 1030, at [314]; Issa v Turkey (2004) 41 EHRR 567, at [68]; Al Saadoon and Mufdhi v United Kingdom (admissibility) (2009) 49 EHRR SE 95, at [85]; Stephens v Malta (No 1)(2009) 50 EHRR 144, at [49]; Medvedyev v France, Grand Chamber, 29 March 2010, at [64].\n",

              "The decisions subsequent to Bankovi in Strasbourg up to the time of Al Skeini were fully discussed by the Divisional Court, the Court of Appeal, and the House of Lords, and it is not necessary to go over the same ground.\n",
              "It is useful only to consider the relevance of the decisions in calan v Turkey (2003) 37 EHRR 238; (2005) 41 EHRR 985 (Grand Chamber) and Issa v Turkey (2004) 41 EHRR 567, and of the decisions subsequent to Al Skeini in Markovic v Italy (2006) 44 EHRR 1045 (Grand Chamber); Al Saadoon and Mufdhi v United Kingdom (admissibility) (2009) 49 EHRR SE 95; and Medvedyev v France, Grand Chamber, 29 March 2010.\n",

              "Directly after he had been handed over by the Kenyan officials to the Turkish officials the applicant was under effective Turkish authority and was therefore brought within the jurisdiction of that State for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention, even though in this instance Turkey exercised its authority outside its territory.\n",
              "The Court considers that the circumstances of the present case are distinguishable from those in the aforementioned Bankovi case, notably in that the applicant was physically forced to return to Turkey by Turkish officials and was subject to their authority and\n",
              "control following his arrest and return to Turkey\n",
              "The Grand Chamber said (at [91]): The Court notes that the applicant was arrested by members of the Turkish security forces inside an aircraft registered in Turkey in the international zone of Nairobi Airport.\n",
              "It is common ground that, directly after being handed over to the Turkish officials by the Kenyan officials, the applicant was under effective Turkish authority and therefore within the jurisdiction of that State for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention, even though in this instance Turkey exercised its authority outside its territory.\n",
              "It is true that the applicant was physically forced to return to Turkey by Turkish officials and was under their authority and control following his arrest and return to Turkey (see, in this respect, the aforementioned decisions in the cases of Illich Ramirez Snchez v France and Freda v Italy; and, by converse implication, the Bankovi v Belgium .\n",
              "There are four features about this decision which should be noted.\n",
              "First, the Turkish Government conceded that the case fell within article 1.\n",
              "Second, it involved, at least in part, acts committed on a Turkish aircraft.\n",
              "Third, the Turkish activities were authorised by Kenya.\n",
              "Fourth (as Lord Brown pointed out in Al Skeini at [118] [119]), it involved the forcible removal by state A from state B with state Bs consent of a person wanted for trial in state A.

              "In Stephens v Malta (No 1) (2009) 50 EHRR 144, at [52], [54], in a section dealing with jurisdiction under article 1, it was held that the arrest of a British citizen in Spain pursuant to an unlawful request for extradition by Malta was attributable to, and engaged the responsibility of, Malta, but the Court did not explain why the applicant was within the jurisdiction of Malta.\n",
              "It is entirely consistent with common sense for the Convention to apply (even to that part of the operation which occurs abroad) when agents of a state go abroad and forcibly remove one of its citizens for trial at home.\n",

              "Issa v Turkey (2004) 41 EHRR 567 has been subject to close analysis and criticism at all levels in Al Skeini.\n",
              "It arose out of an incursion by Turkish troops into Northern Iraq in 1995 to pursue and eliminate Turkish terrorists who were seeking shelter in Iraq.\n",
              "The applicants were Iraqi villagers who alleged that in contravention of their Convention rights and those of their relatives, Turkish troops had (among other things) detained, tortured, and killed villagers and caused distress to others.\n",
              "The Court decided that the applicants relatives did not come within the jurisdiction of Turkey within the meaning of article 1.\n",
              "Citing Loizidou v Turkey (Merits) (1996) 23 EHRR 513, at [52], the Court re stated (but for the first time in relation to territory outside the Convention states) that the responsibility of a state could be engaged where as a consequence of military action, whether lawful or unlawful, the state in practice exercised effective control of an area situated outside its national territory: [68] [69].\n",
              "That deals with jurisdiction based on control of territory, and not jurisdiction based on authority and control of the victim by state agents outside the territory of the state.\n",
              "In a much discussed passage, the Court said (at [71]) Moreover, a State may also be held accountable for violation of the Convention rights and freedoms of persons who are in the territory of another State but who are found to be under the former States authority and control through its agents operating whether lawfully or unlawfully in the latter State Accountability in such situations stems from the fact that Article 1 of the Convention cannot be interpreted so as to allow a State party to perpetrate violations of the Convention on the territory of another State, which it could not perpetrate on its own territory (ibid).\n",
              "Consequently, jurisdiction could have been based on either effective control of the area or (although the formulation is by no means clear) on the activities of state agents against local inhabitants.\n",
              "But the applicants were not within the jurisdiction of Turkey because Turkey did not exercise effective control over the relevant area, and also because it had not been proved that Turkish forces had conducted operations in the area in question: [75], [81].\n",
              "It is implicit in the reasoning in this decision that there would have been jurisdiction if the Turkish troops had been guilty of atrocities even without overall control of the area.\n",
              "If that is so, it is inconsistent with Bankovi.\n",
              "It is impossible to see how an attack on villagers in a cross border incursion into a non contracting state could make the villagers within the jurisdiction of Turkey, when a bombing raid on Belgrade did not make the victims within the jurisdiction of the NATO States involved.\n",
              "The notion of authority and control through State agents operating abroad derives from the report of the Inter American Commission of Human Rights in Coard v United States (Report No 109/99, 29 September 1999) (1999) 9 BHRC 150, which was cited by the Strasbourg court in Issa v Turkey at [71] in support of that notion.\n",
              "The Commission was examining complaints about the applicants detention and treatment by United States forces in the military operation in Grenada.\n",
              "The American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man 1948 contains no express provision on its territorial limits.\n",
              "The Commission said: While the extraterritorial application of the Declaration has not been placed at issue by the parties Given that individual rights inhere simply by virtue of a persons humanity, each American state is obliged to uphold the protected rights of any person subject to its jurisdiction.\n",
              "While this most commonly refers to persons within a states territory, it may, under given circumstances, refer to conduct with an extraterritorial locus where the person concerned is present in the territory of one state, but subject to the control of another state usually through the acts of the latters agents abroad.\n",
              "In principle, the inquiry turns not on the presumed victims nationality or presence within a particular geographic area, but on whether, under the specific circumstances, the state observed the rights of a person subject to its authority and control.\n",
              "The Coard report was referred to in Bankovi at [23] and [78], but the Grand Chamber (at [78]) specifically indicated that it derived no assistance from it because the American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man 1948 contained no explicit limitation of jurisdiction.\n",
              "Jurisdiction on the basis of authority and control (especially outside the Convention states) as a separate head was firmly rejected by the House of Lords in Al Skeini: see especially Lord Brown at [116] [127], and Lord Rodger at [73] [77]; and see also Rix LJ speaking for the Administrative Court at [216], and Brooke LJ in the Court of Appeal at [103].\n",
              "Not only is there no firm basis in authority for the notion of authority and control as a basis of jurisdiction under article 1, Issa is also inconsistent with the notion of the regional nature of the Convention.\n",
              "As Lord Rodger said in Al Skeini (at [78]): The essentially regional nature of the Convention is relevant to the way that the court operates.\n",
              "It has judges elected from all the contracting states, not from anywhere else.\n",
              "The judges purport to interpret and apply the various rights in the Convention in accordance with what they conceive to be developments in prevailing attitudes in the contracting states.\n",
              "This is obvious from the court's jurisprudence on such matters as the death penalty, sex discrimination, homosexuality and transsexuals.\n",
              "The result is a body of law which may reflect the values of the contracting states, but which most certainly does not reflect those in many other parts of the world.\n",
              "So the idea that the United Kingdom was obliged to secure observance of all the rights and freedoms as interpreted by the European Court in the utterly different society of southern Iraq is manifestly absurd.\n",
              "Hence, as noted in Bankovi, 11 BHRC 435, 453 454, para 80, the court had so far recognised jurisdiction based on effective control only in the case of territory which would normally be covered by the Convention.\n",
              "If it went further, the court would run the risk not only of colliding with the jurisdiction of other human rights bodies but of being accused of human rights imperialism.\n",

              "In Medvedyev v France, Grand Chamber, 29 March 2010, the applicants alleged that they had been arbitrarily deprived of their liberty contrary to article 5(1) following the boarding of the ship on which they were crewmen by French authorities and complained that they had not been brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power.\n",
              "The ship was registered in Cambodia.\n",
              "Cambodia had given France authorisation to intercept the ship.\n",
              "The Court held unanimously (although it was divided on the merits of the claim) that because France exercised full and exclusive control over the ship and its crew, at least de facto, from the time of its interception, in a continuous and uninterrupted manner until they were tried in France, the applicants were effectively within Frances jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1: at [67].\n",
              "This case bears some resemblance to calan v Turkey (2003) 37 EHRR 238, except that the aircraft in calan was registered in Turkey, the respondent state, whereas the ship in Medvedyev v France was registered in Cambodia, and the applicant in calan had the nationality of the respondent state, whereas the applicants in Medvedyev had a variety of non French nationalities, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek and Chilean.\n",
              "The differences are not crucial, since although an aircraft is for some purposes regarded as part of the territory of the country of registration, while it is in an airport it is no sense exempt from the criminal and public law of the territorial state, and non nationals within the jurisdiction are equally entitled to the protection of Convention rights.\n",
              "Al Saadoon and Mufdhi v United Kingdom (admissibility)\n",
              "Nor is Al Saadoon and Mufdhi v United Kingdom (admissibility) (2009) 49 EHRR SE 95 authority for any concept of extra territoriality going beyond Bankovi as recognised in Al Skeini.\n",
              "The applicants complained that their transfer by British forces to the custody of the Iraqi High Tribunal exposed them to a real risk of the death penalty in breach of articles 2 and 3.\n",
              "The United Kingdoms argument on jurisdiction was that the transfer of the applicants into the custody of the Iraqi authorities took place in circumstances where the United Kingdom forces had the power to detain Iraqi nationals only at the request of the Iraqi courts; the United Kingdom forces were not to retain any power to detain Iraqi nationals after 31 December 2008 and, within hours of the actual transfer, the base would have ceased to be inviolable and the Iraqi authorities would have had the right to come physically to the base where the applicants were detained and remove them.\n",
              "Consequently, it was argued, the United Kingdom was not exercising any public powers through the effective control of any part of the territory or the inhabitants of Iraq,\n",
              "The Court recognised that, during the first months of the detention of the applicants, the United Kingdom was an occupying power in Iraq.\n",
              "The United Kingdom exercised control and authority over the individuals detained in the British run detention facilities initially solely as a result of the use of military force.\n",
              "Subsequently its de facto control over the premises was reflected by the CPA order which provided that all premises used by the multi national force should be inviolable and subject to the exclusive control and authority of the multi national force: [87].\n",
              "Given the total and exclusive de facto and subsequently also de jure control exercised by United Kingdom authorities over the premises, the individuals detained there, including the applicants, were within the United Kingdoms jurisdiction: Hess v United Kingdom.\n",
              "That conclusion, the Court said (at [88]), was consistent with the decision of the House of Lords in Al Skeini and the position adopted by the United Kingdom in that case before the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords (where it had been conceded that the jurisdiction under article 1 extended to a military prison occupied and controlled by the United Kingdom).\n",
              "The Court referred to Rasul v Bush, 542 US 466 (2004) where the United States Supreme Court decided (6 3) that United States courts had jurisdiction to consider challenges to the legality of the detention of foreign nationals incarcerated in Guantanamo Bay, since by the express terms of the agreements with Cuba, the United States exercised complete jurisdiction and control over the Guantanamo Bay.\n",
              "See also Al Saadoon and Mufdhi v United Kingdom (Merits), 2 March 2010, with many references to the United Kingdoms jurisdiction over the applicants: [137], [140], [164], [165].\n",

              "The concept of a jurisdictional link and Markovic v Italy\n",
              "The conclusion of the Court in Bankovi (at [82]) was that there was no jurisdictional link between the persons who were victims of the act complained of and the respondent states.\n",
              "There was no elucidation of that expression, and the only other decision of the Strasbourg court in the article 1 context which makes use of the notion of jurisdictional link is Markovic v Italy (2006) 44 EHRR 1045 (Grand Chamber), in which the Court said that once a person brings a civil action in the courts or tribunals of a state, there indisputably exists, without prejudice to the outcome of the proceedings, a jurisdictional link for the purposes of article 1 ([54]).\n",
              "Markovic v Italy is a decision which shows that the victim of a breach of the Convention need not necessarily be present in the contracting state.\n",
              "The applicants were nationals of Serbia and Montenegro, who had brought claims in the Italian courts for compensation for damage caused by an airstrike by NATO forces.\n",
              "The Italian Court of Cassation ruled that the Italian courts had no jurisdiction because the claim was a political one.\n",
              "The applicants claimed that this was a refusal to grant them access to a court in breach of article 6.\n",
              "The Court held that there was no breach of article 6 because the inability to sue the state was not the result of an immunity but of the principles governing the substantive right of action in domestic law.\n",
              "The Court held that the applicants were within the jurisdiction of Italy for the purposes of article 1.\n",
              "The Italian and British Governments argued that there was no jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1 because (for reasons which are hard to follow) the underlying claim related to NATO airstrikes outside the Convention countries.\n",
              "But, apart from that, they both accepted that a claimant from outside the contracting states who brings a claim in the courts of the contracting state is within its jurisdiction for article 1 purposes.\n",
              "The Italian Government accepted that the applicants had brought themselves within the ambit of the states jurisdiction by lodging a claim with the authorities: see [38].\n",
              "The British Government seemed (somewhat artificially) to treat the bringing of the claim as a notional entry into the territory in order to bring proceedings: see [48].\n",
              "As regards jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1, the Court three times used the expression jurisdictional link in these passages: 54.\n",
              "Even though the extraterritorial nature of the events alleged to have been at the origin of an action may have an effect on the applicability of Article 6 and the final outcome of the proceedings, it cannot under any circumstances affect the jurisdiction ratione loci and ratione personae of the State concerned.\n",
              "If civil proceedings are brought in the domestic courts, the State is required by Article 1 of the Convention to secure in those proceedings respect for the rights protected by Article 6.\n",
              "The Court considers that once a person brings a civil action in the courts or tribunals of a State, there indisputably exists, without prejudice to the outcome of the proceedings, a jurisdictional link for the purposes of Article 1. 55.\n",
              "The Court notes that the applicants in the instant case brought an action in the Italian civil courts.\n",
              "Consequently, it finds that a jurisdictional link existed between them and the Italian State.\n",
              "The expression jurisdictional link in the conclusion in Bankovi (at [82]) is plainly not intended to state or represent a separate and independent test of jurisdiction, and the same must be so of the passages in Markovic v Italy.\n",
              "Consequently, neither of those decisions suggests that there is a separate free standing head of jurisdiction based on a jurisdictional link, and (contrary to the respondents position on this appeal) there is nothing in the opinion of Lord Rodger in Al Skeini which supports such a suggestion.\n",
              "He said (at [64]) It is important therefore to recognise that, when considering the question of jurisdiction under the Convention, the focus has shifted to the victim or, more precisely, to the link between the victim and the contracting state [F]or the purposes of deciding whether the Convention applies outside the territory of the United Kingdom, the key question is whether the deceased were linked to the United Kingdom when they were killed.\n",
              "However reprehensible, however contrary to any common understanding of respect for human rights, the alleged conduct of the British forces might have been, it had no legal consequences under the Convention, unless there was that link and the deceased were within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom at the time.\n",
              "For, only then would the United Kingdom have owed them any obligation in international law to secure their rights under article 2 of the Convention and only then would their relatives have had any rights under the 1998 Act.\n",
              "All that Lord Rodger was saying was that there must be a relevant link, not that a link, or any link, is a sufficient basis for the existence of jurisdiction under article 1.\n",
              "It should be added in relation to Markovic v Italy that it makes complete sense for the Convention to apply to parties to litigation in contracting states irrespective of where they are.\n",
              "It could not be seriously suggested, for example, that a Japanese defendant in English proceedings who is served out of the jurisdiction is not entitled to article 6 rights.\n",
              "In Lubbe v Cape plc [2000] 1 WLR 1545 the South African asbestosis victims suing in England submitted that to stay the proceedings in favour of the South African forum would violate their article 6 rights.\n",
              "A stay was refused on the non Convention ground that, because of the lack of funding and legal representation in South Africa, they would be denied a fair trial on terms of equality with the defendant.\n",
              "Lord Bingham said (at p 1561) that article 6 did not support any conclusion which was not already reached on application of the stay principles Spiliada Maritime Corpn v Cansulex Ltd [1987] AC 460.\n",
              "There was no suggestion, nor could there have been, that the claimants could not rely on article 6 because they were South Africans without any connection with the United Kingdom.\n",
              "In Bankovi the Court said [75] that the obligation in article 1 could not be divided and tailored in accordance with the particular circumstances of the extra territorial act in question, and the Court has said that in territory which is subject to the effective control of a contracting state the obligation of the State is to secure the entire range of substantive Convention rights Bankovi at [70], citing Cyprus v Turkey (2001) 35 EHRR 731 at [77].\n",
              "But cases such as Markovic v Italy suggest that some qualification is necessary to the principle of indivisibility of Convention rights, and that there may be cases in which a person may be within the jurisdiction of a contracting state for limited purposes only.\n",
              "Another possible example is suggested by Carson v United Kingdom, Grand Chamber, 16 March 2010 (in which there was no issue under article 1).\n",
              "The applicants were persons who had worked in the United Kingdom and paid national insurance contributions and then emigrated to South Africa, Canada or Australia.\n",
              "State pensions to persons abroad were not up rated to take account of inflation with the result that they received less (far less in some cases).\n",
              "They failed in their claim under article 14 of the Convention and article 1 of the First Protocol, but rightly it was never suggested that because they were permanently abroad they were not within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for article 1 purposes in relation to interference with property situate in the United Kingdom (as the pension rights were).\n",
              "Consequently there may be cases in which persons abroad may not be entitled to the whole package of Convention rights.\n",
              "Conclusions\n",
              "Bankovi made it clear that article 1 was not to be interpreted as a living instrument in accordance with changing conditions: [64] [65].\n",
              "It is hardly conceivable that in 1950 the framers of the Convention would have intended the Convention to apply to the armed forces of Council of Europe states engaged in operations in the Middle East or elsewhere outside the contracting states.\n",
              "Even the limited exceptions to territoriality recognised by the Strasbourg court were plainly not contemplated in the drafting process.\n",
              "The original draft prepared by the Committee of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe on legal and administrative questions referred to all persons residing within their territories.\n",
              "Following a suggestion that residing within be replaced by living in, the Expert Intergovernmental Committee decided instead on persons within their jurisdiction.\n",
              "The reason was that the term residing might be considered too restrictive, and there were good grounds for extending the benefits of the Convention to all persons in the territories of the signatory states, even those who could not be considered as residing there in the legal sense of the word: Collected Edition of the Travaux Prparatoires of the European Convention on Human Rights, vol III, p 260.\n",
              "Apart from a comment by M Rolin, the eminent Belgian representative to the Consultative Assembly, that the protections would extend to all individuals of whatever nationality, who on the territory of any one of the states, might have had reason to complain that their rights were violated, article 1 did not give rise to any further discussion on this aspect and that text was adopted by the Consultative Assembly on 25 August 1950 without further amendment: Collected Edition, vol VI, pp 132, 148.\n",
              "See Bankovi at [19] [21] and also Lawson, Life After Bankovic: On the Extraterritorial Application of the European Convention on Human Rights, in Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties, ed Coomans and Kamminga, 2004, 83, at 89 90.\n",
              "There is nothing in the drafting history to give the slightest credence to the proposition that the Convention was to apply to the relations of the state with its armed forces abroad.\n",
              "It is noteworthy that, writing in the same year, Professor Hersch Lauterpacht (as he then was) produced a draft of the International Bill of the Rights of Man which provided (article 18): The obligations of this Bill of Rights shall be binding upon States in relation both to their metropolitan territory and to any other territory under their control and jurisdiction.\n",

              "Bankovi (as applied in Al Skeini) confirms that article 1 reflects the territorial notion of jurisdiction, and that other bases of jurisdiction are exceptional and require special justification.\n",
              "In practice the exceptions recognised by the Court have either consisted of (1) territorial jurisdiction by a state over the territory of another contracting state; (2) extensions of territorial jurisdiction by analogy; and (3) commonsense extensions of the notion of jurisdiction to fit cases which plainly should be within the scope of the Convention.\n",
              "The Northern Cyprus cases such as Loizidou v Turkey (Merits) and Cyprus v Turkey, and also Ilacu v Moldova and Russia and Assanidze v Georgia are all illustrations of the extension or application of territoriality to cases of effective control (or lack of control) by contracting states of Council of Europe territory.\n",
              "The extension of the Convention to military bases and hospitals (ultimately based on concession by the Secretary of State) in Al Skeini and Al Saadoon and Mufdhi v United Kingdom (admissibility) is consistent with the treatment in dicta of the Commission and the Court of fixed premises abroad as territorial extensions of the state.\n",
              "If the judges in Drozd v France and Spain had been acting as French or Spanish judges commonsense would have recognised them as extensions of the state judiciary acting abroad.\n",
              "So also in cases such as calan v Turkey and Medvedyev v France, where a states officials detain a person abroad for trial in its territory, it would be odd if there could be no complaint under the Convention in respect of the acts which took place outside the territory.\n",
              "Similarly, the application of article 6 rights to foreign claimants in Markovic v Italy makes complete sense: it would be a travesty of the Convention to deny them the right to access to a court because they were outside the Convention states.\n",
              "This case comes within none of the exceptions recognised by the Strasbourg court, and there is no basis in its case law, or in principle, for the proposition that the jurisdiction which states undoubtedly have over their armed forces abroad both in national law and international law means that they are within their jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1.\n",
              "For the reasons given in the preceding sections of this judgment, jurisdiction cannot be established simply on the basis that the United Kingdoms armed forces abroad are under the authority and control of the United Kingdom, or that there is a jurisdictional link between the United Kingdom and those armed forces.\n",
              "To the extent that Issa v Turkey states a principle of jurisdiction based solely on authority and control by state agents over individuals abroad, it is inconsistent with Bankovi, and with Al Skeini, where it was comprehensively criticised by the House of Lords.\n",
              "Nor is there anything in Markovic v Italy or in Lord Rodgers opinion in Al Skeini to support a jurisdictional link as a free standing basis for jurisdiction under article 1.\n",
              "Nor are there policy grounds for extending the scope of the Convention to armed forces abroad.\n",
              "On the contrary, to extend the Convention in this way would ultimately involve the courts in issues relating to the conduct of armed hostilities which are essentially non justiciable.\n",
              "I would therefore allow the appeal on the first issue.\n",
              "On the second issue, I agree with the judgment of Lord Phillips and would dismiss the appeal.\n",
              "LORD KERR\n",
              "Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms provides that the High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention.\n",
              "The first issue in this appeal is concerned with the question of what is meant by the phrase, within their jurisdiction.\n",
              "I have read the judgment of Lord Mance and am in complete agreement with what he has said on the first issue.\n",
              "For the reasons that he has given, I too would dismiss the appeal on the first ground.\n",
              "The first issue\n",
              "It has been accepted in a series of decisions, both domestic and European, that the primary and essential basis for jurisdiction under article 1 is territorial.\n",
              "It has also been accepted that this important principle is subject to exceptions.\n",
              "A central issue on the first ground of appeal is whether the admissible exceptions are confined to those specific examples that have been expressly recognised by the decisions in this field, particularly those reached in Strasbourg, or whether further exceptions may be recognised by the application of principles already established by the European Court of Human Rights.\n",
              "In R (Gentle) v Prime Minister [2008] UKHL 20; [2008] AC 1356, Lord Bingham clearly contemplated that any exceptions to or extensions of the principle of territoriality should be specific and limited see para 8(3) of his opinion.\n",
              "That case of course involved a claim that the lawfulness of the war in Iraq should be investigated in order to test whether the United Kingdom had fulfilled what were said to be its article 2 obligations to soldiers who were exposed to the risk of death in that war.\n",
              "It was not concerned with the question that arises here whether a soldier who is within the control of the state, in the form of the army authorities, remains within the jurisdiction of the state for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention when he is outside the states national territory.\n",
              "As Lord Mance has pointed out, Lord Bingham outlined three reasons that article 2 had never been held to apply to the process of deciding on the lawfulness of a resort to arms.\n",
              "The first was that the lawfulness of military action has no immediate bearing on the risk of fatalities.\n",
              "The second was that the draftsmen of the European Convention had not envisaged that it could provide a suitable framework or machinery for resolving questions about the resort to war.\n",
              "The final reason related to the territoriality issue.\n",
              "On this point, Lord Bingham said: Subject to limited exceptions and specific extensions, the application of the Convention is territorial: the rights and freedoms are ordinarily to be secured to those within the borders of the state and not outside.\n",
              "Here, the deaths of Fusilier Gentle and Trooper Clarke occurred in Iraq and although they were subject to the authority of the defendants they were clearly not within the jurisdiction of the UK as that expression in the Convention has been interpreted: R (Al Skeini) v Secretary of State for Defence [2008] AC 153, paras 79, 129.\n",
              "The Al Skeini case involved the deaths of six Iraqi civilians at the hands of British troops.\n",
              "Five of the deceased were shot in the course of security operations; the sixth, Mr Mousa, died following gross ill treatment while in custody in a UK military detention facility.\n",
              "The appellants, who were relatives of the deceased, asked the Secretary of State to hold a public inquiry into their relatives' deaths.\n",
              "The Secretary of State indicated that he would not hold such an inquiry.\n",
              "The appellants sought judicial review of that decision.\n",
              "In order to promote that application the appellants had to establish (among other things) that their complaint fell within the scope of ECHR and that a Convention right had been violated.\n",
              "The violation alleged by the appellants consisted primarily of a failure to investigate, as required by article 2, a violent death alleged to have been caused by agents of the state.\n",
              "The House of Lords held that the Convention operated in an essentially regional context, most notably in the legal space of the contracting states (ie within the area of the Council of Europe countries).\n",
              "The jurisdiction under article 1 was primarily territorial.\n",
              "The House of Lords recognised, however, that exceptions to that principle existed.\n",
              "These included circumstances where the state had effective control of a foreign territory and its inhabitants through military occupation or by the consent, invitation or acquiescence of the government of that territory and it exercised all or some of the public powers that would normally have been exercised by the local government.\n",
              "This was the context in which the observations in paras 79 and 129 of Al Skeini (on which Lord Bingham relied in Gentle) were made.\n",
              "The statements of Lord Rodger in para 79 of Al Skeini were based largely on his consideration of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Bankovic v Belgium (2001) 11 BHRC 435.\n",
              "That case has been extensively discussed in the judgment of Lord Phillips and it is therefore unnecessary for me to rehearse its details.\n",
              "It should be noted, however, that in para 80 the court observed that Strasbourg had so far recognised jurisdiction based on effective control only in the case of territory which would normally be covered by the Convention.\n",
              "From this one can safely assume that it was not contemplated that the exceptions would be confined solely to this situation and, indeed, further extensions to the exceptional category have been recognised in later decisions of ECtHR.\n",
              "The observation in para 80 of Bankovic provided the backdrop for what Lord Rodger said at para 79 of Al Skeini: The essentially regional nature of the Convention has a bearing on another aspect of the decision in Bankovic v Belgium (2001) 11 BHRC 435.\n",
              "In the circumstances of that case the respondent states were plainly in no position to secure to everyone in the RTS station or even in Belgrade all the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of the Convention.\n",
              "So the applicants had to argue that it was enough that the respondents were in a position to secure the victims rights under articles 2, 10 and 13 of the Convention.\n",
              "In effect, the applicants were arguing that it was not an answer to say that, because a state was unable to guarantee everything, it was required to guarantee nothingto adopt the words of Sedley LJ, [2007] QB 140, 300, para 197.\n",
              "The European Court quite specifically rejected that line of argument.\n",
              "The court held, (2001) 11 BHRC 435, 452, para 75, that the obligation in article 1 could not be divided and tailored in accordance with the particular circumstances of the extra territorial act in question.\n",
              "In other words, the whole package of rights applies and must be secured where a contracting state has jurisdiction.\n",
              "This merely reflects the normal understanding that a contracting state cannot pick and choose among the rights in the Convention: it must secure them all to everyone within its jurisdiction.\n",
              "If that is so, then it suggests that the obligation under art 1 can arise only where the contracting state has such effective control of the territory of another state that it could secure to everyone in the territory all the rights and freedoms in Section I of the Convention.\n",
              "It is important, I believe, to note that these comments were made in the context of jurisdiction based on territorial control.\n",
              "This is clear from para 75 of Bankovic, on which they are founded.\n",
              "But the present case is not one of territorial control.\n",
              "It is, rather, a case of control of personnel.\n",
              "Soldiers serving in Iraq were under the complete control of the United Kingdom authorities.\n",
              "They were subject to UK law.\n",
              "They were not amenable to the law of Iraq.\n",
              "The only legal system to which they were answerable or to which they might have recourse was that of the United Kingdom.\n",
              "In these circumstances, one may ask, if they were not within the jurisdiction of the UK, in whose jurisdiction were they? The answer that the appellant impliedly gives to this question is that the soldiers were within the jurisdiction of the UK for all purposes except for those of article 1 of the Convention but that response merely prompts the further question, why and, for reasons that I shall touch on below, to that second query I can find no satisfactory reply.\n",
              "Para 129 of Al Skeini (the other passage on which Lord Bingham relied in Gentle) is equally concerned with the question of territorial control.\n",
              "There Lord Brown said: except where a state really does have effective control of territory, it cannot hope to secure Convention rights within that territory and, unless it is within the area of the Council of Europe, it is unlikely in any event to find certain of the Convention rights it is bound to secure reconcilable with the customs of the resident population.\n",
              "Indeed it goes further than that.\n",
              "During the period in question here it is common ground that the UK was an occupying power in southern Iraq and bound as such by Geneva IV and by the Hague Regulations.\n",
              "Article 43 of the Hague Regulations provides that the occupant shall take all the measures in his power to restore and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.\n",
              "The appellants argue that occupation within the meaning of the Hague Regulations necessarily involves the occupant having effective control of the area and so being responsible for securing there all Convention rights and freedoms.\n",
              "So far as this being the case, however, the occupants' obligation is to respect the laws in force, not to introduce laws and the means to enforce them (for example, courts and a justice system) such as to satisfy the requirements of the Convention.\n",
              "Often (for example where Sharia law is in force) Convention rights would clearly be incompatible with the laws of the territory occupied.\n",
              "It is immediately evident that Lord Brown was discussing the nature and degree of control that was required before the territorial control exception could arise.\n",
              "The principal message as it seems to me to emerge from this passage is that the extent of the occupants actual control over the territory in question was very far from complete and therefore entirely incompatible with a capacity to enforce compliance with the Convention.\n",
              "On that account, the extra territorial exception could not be held to apply.\n",
              "When one approaches the matter from the perspective of power over military personnel, however, the level of control of the UK occupying forces is of an altogether different order from that which they could exert over the territory.\n",
              "The control that the UK had over Private Smith was as complete as it is possible in todays world to be.\n",
              "Moreover, for the reasons given by Lord Mance in paras 185 188 of his judgment, no other agency or state was entitled to or could exercise any authority over him.\n",
              "In plain terms, he did not come within any legal order or jurisdiction other than that of the United Kingdom.\n",
              "I therefore respectfully agree with Lord Mance that Lord Binghams statement in Gentle that the soldiers, although subject to the authority of the United Kingdom government, were clearly not within the jurisdiction of the UK must be treated with some reservation.\n",
              "Neither Lord Rodger nor Lord Brown (in the paragraphs of their opinions in Al Skeini that Lord Bingham relied on) had addressed the question whether serving soldiers came within the states jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "Although a number of other members of the House of Lords in Gentle agreed in general terms with Lord Bingham, like Lord Mance, I doubt that his statement that the soldiers were not within the jurisdiction of the UK forms part of the ratio decidendi of that case.\n",
              "Even if it does, in light of the much fuller argument that this court has received on the topic than was presented to the House of Lords in Gentle, it is right that the matter should be considered again.\n",
              "Lord Brown discussed in Al Skeini the exceptions that had been already identified to the strict territorial basis for jurisdiction and Lord Mance has analysed these in paras 172 to 179 of his judgment.\n",
              "I agree with his analysis and with his conclusion that underpinning each of the exceptions is the exercise by a state in a country other than its national territory of power over individuals by the consent, invitation or acquiescence of the foreign state.\n",
              "The exclusion of extra territorial jurisdiction of one state in the territory of another rests primarily on the sovereign territorial rights of the latter state.\n",
              "As the court in Bankovic said, a States competence to exercise jurisdiction over its own nationals abroad is subordinate to that States and other States territorial competence para 60.\n",
              "Where, however, a state yields authority to a foreign state to exercise power in its sovereign territory, this principle does not apply.\n",
              "Likewise, if the sovereignty of the original state is ousted by an occupying force, the occupiers jurisdiction replaces that of the original state.\n",
              "In the present case both these situations so far as they involved UK military personnel tend to blend into each other.\n",
              "The UK was certainly permitted to exercise power over its soldiers, although this could not be said to be a permission granted by the state having original sovereignty over Iraq since that states sovereignty had been ousted by the invading forces.\n",
              "In so far as the UKs authority to exercise power over its own forces depended on the grant of permission, however, that was certainly constituted by CPA Order No 17 and Security Council Resolution No 1483.\n",
              "For the reasons given by Lord Mance in paras 184 to 186 of his judgment, I also consider that the UK exercised exclusive jurisdiction over its forces by reason of its being an occupying power.\n",
              "The situation can be described simply in the following way: the United Kingdom brought its soldiers into Iraq; it not only asserted complete authority over them while they remained there, it explicitly excluded the exercise of authority over those soldiers by any other agency or state; and it has always been clear that soldiers remain subject to the laws of the UK during their service abroad.\n",
              "In those circumstances it would be, to my mind, wholly anomalous to say that soldiers did not remain within the jurisdiction of the UK while serving in Iraq especially since it has been accepted in Al Skeini and not disputed by the appellant in the present case that all persons while on premises under the control of the army are within the UKs jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "In Bankovic there were no fewer than 17 respondent states: Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom.\n",
              "It is interesting and significant that all seventeen subscribed to an argument described in this way in para 36 of the courts judgment: As to the precise meaning of 'jurisdiction', [the respondent governments] suggest that it should be interpreted in accordance with the ordinary and well established meaning of that term in public international law.\n",
              "The exercise of 'jurisdiction' therefore involves the assertion or exercise of legal authority, actual or purported, over persons owing some form of allegiance to that state or who have been brought within that state's control.\n",
              "They also suggest that the term 'jurisdiction' generally entails some form of structured relationship normally existing over a period of time.\n",
              "Of course, most soldiers serving on behalf of a member state in a foreign country would come clearly within the first of these formulations since they are subject to the legal authority of the government of their native country and they owe allegiance to that state.\n",
              "The court in Bankovic did not comment adversely on the argument that a states exercise abroad of legal authority over persons owing allegiance to that state would satisfy the requirements of article 1.\n",
              "Indeed, the courts treatment of the arguments of the parties is not at all inconsistent with that submission.\n",
              "It is to be noted that the final conclusions expressed by the court in paras 67 to 71 are preceded by the cross heading Extra territorial acts recognised as constituting an exercise of jurisdiction (emphasis added).\n",
              "By making its soldiers subject to its sole authority while abroad a state is not engaging in an extra territorial act so much as creating a state of affairs.\n",
              "There may not be much in this point but it is, I think, worth remarking that the focus of the court in Bankovic was whether the actions of the respondent governments might be a sufficient foundation for concluding that the applicants came within their jurisdiction whereas here the essential issue is whether soldiers who are subject to the exclusive legal control of the UK authorities remain within its jurisdiction.\n",
              "There is nothing in Bankovic which speaks directly to the question whether a member state that takes its soldiers abroad, asserts that it has sole authority over them and expressly excludes all other possible forms of control over them can nevertheless claim that those soldiers are not within its jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "To suggest, as the Secretary of State must, that soldiers are within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for every conceivable legal purpose other than article 1 seems to me to involve the acceptance of one anomaly too many.\n",
              "In this appeal the Secretary of State has argued that, because it is impossible to secure the whole package of Convention rights for soldiers serving abroad, it should be concluded that they cannot be within the UKs jurisdiction for article 1 purposes.\n",
              "Expressed in this unvarnished way, the argument appears circular or, at least, intensely pragmatic.\n",
              "But a similar argument found favour with ECtHR in Bankovic and with the House of Lords in Al Skeini.\n",
              "One must consider, therefore, whether this is a universally required prerequisite in order to bring an applicant within the jurisdiction.\n",
              "As Lord Phillips has pointed out (in para 43 of his judgment), the European Court in Drozd and Janousek v France and Spain (1992) 14 EHRR 745 accepted that if the applicants had appeared before a French judge sitting in that capacity in Andorra they would have been within the jurisdiction of France for the purposes of article 1 in relation to their article 6 rights.\n",
              "They would not have been entitled to claim against France the benefit of protection of the other Convention rights, however.\n",
              "It is implicit in that judgment that there are certain settings in which the whole package principle does not apply.\n",
              "In other words, there is not an invariable pre condition that one must be able to have access to the entire panoply of Convention rights in order to be able to claim that one is within the jurisdiction of the member state for the purposes of article 1.\n",
              "Likewise in Carson v United Kingdom (Application No 42184/05) (unreported) 16 March 2010, the decision of the Grand Chamber on the admissibility of claims against the United Kingdom by persons who were resident abroad must have proceeded on the basis that they were within the jurisdiction for the purposes of pursuing a claim of violation of article 14 of the Convention in combination with article 1 of the First Protocol.\n",
              "There was no question of the applicants being entitled to the benefit of other Convention rights.\n",
              "It follows that the whole package of rights principle is not an indispensable requirement in every case.\n",
              "It is not necessary in every instance that it be shown that an applicant, in order to be entitled to claim that he is within the jurisdiction for article 1 purposes, must also show that he is entitled to the benefit of all the Convention rights.\n",
              "It appears to me that this principle is primarily relevant in the territorial control context.\n",
              "One can understand that an applicant who claims that he is entitled to be regarded as within the jurisdiction of a member state on the basis that he was, at the material time, within the territory controlled by that state should be able to demonstrate that the state was in a position to deliver all the protections secured by the Convention.\n",
              "In that instance the capacity of the state (or its lack of capacity) to deliver that breadth of protection can be seen as a measure of the extent of its control of the territory.\n",
              "Having examined the cases of Drozd; X and Y v Switzerland (1977) 9 DR 57; Gentilhomme, Schaff Benhadji and Zerouki v France (Application Nos 48205/99, 48207/99, 48209/99) (unreported) 14 May 2002, Lord Phillips suggests that they might be thought to support a general principle that there will be jurisdiction under article 1 whenever a state exercises legislative, judicial or executive authority which affects a Convention right of a person, whether or not he is within the territory of that state.\n",
              "He points out, however, that the Strasbourg court had not yet propounded such a principle.\n",
              "I agree that no principle in these precise terms has been articulated by the ECtHR but where the exercise of such authority is combined with control over the individual affected, it appears to me that the extra territorial extension of jurisdiction is undeniable.\n",
              "The essence of the decisions in Bankovic and Al Skeini is that an exception to the territorial basis for jurisdiction will be recognised where there is effective control of the relevant territory and its inhabitants by an occupying force.\n",
              "The rationale for the decision is surely the element of control.\n",
              "Where the occupying force supplants and replaces the power which had been wielded by the national authority, it provides, indeed imposes, its own jurisdiction.\n",
              "No particular magic attaches to the geographical dimension of this exercise of power it is the comprehensive nature of the power rather than the area where it is exerted that matters.\n",
              "Obviously, in those areas where the occupying force is unable to exert a measure of power that might be regarded as effective, its jurisdiction will not be established but that is a reflection of the restriction on the power rather than of geography.\n",
              "And so, where the control of an individual is of a sufficiently comprehensive nature as to qualify for the description, effective power, there is no reason in logic or principle that he should not be regarded as being within the jurisdiction of the state which wields that power over him.\n",
              "If a state can export its jurisdiction by taking control of an area abroad, why should it not equally be able to export the jurisdiction when it takes control of an individual?\n",
              "I agree with Lord Phillips that, despite some indications to the contrary, the case law of Strasbourg has not yet developed to the point of recognising a general principle that there will be jurisdiction under article 1 whenever a State exercises legislative, judicial or executive authority in a way that affects an individuals Convention right, whether that person is within the territory of that State or not.\n",
              "But where an individual is under the complete control of his native state while in foreign territory, I cannot see any reason that he should be regarded as being any less within its jurisdiction than individuals who happen to find themselves in a location in that territory which is under the effective control of the same state.\n",
              "And it appears to me that this position has already been recognised, albeit somewhat obliquely, by the ECtHR.\n",
              "In Issa v Turkey (2004) 41 EHRR 567 the court said at para 71: a State may also be held accountable for violation of the Convention rights and freedoms of persons who are in the territory of another State but who are found to be under the former States authority and control through its agents operating whether lawfully or unlawfully in the latter State.\n",
              "Lord Phillips suggests that this passage clearly advances state agent authority as an alternative to effective territorial control as a basis of article 1 jurisdiction.\n",
              "I agree.\n",
              "But, more significantly, it emphasises the importance of control (whether of territory or individuals) as the essential ingredient in extra territorial jurisdiction.\n",
              "That theme featured again in the recent decision of the Grand Chamber in Medvedyev v France (Application No 3394/03) judgment delivered on 29 March 2010.\n",
              "In that case a special forces team from a French warship boarded a merchant vessel which, it was suspected, was carrying drugs.\n",
              "After boarding the vessel, the French commando team kept the crew members of the merchant ship under their exclusive guard and confined them to their cabins during the rerouting of the ship to France.\n",
              "At para 67 the court said: the court considers that, as this was a case of France having exercised full and exclusive control (my emphasis) over the [merchant vessel] and its crew, at least de facto, from the time of its interception, in a continuous and uninterrupted manner until they were tried in France, the applicants were effectively within Frances jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "The exercise of control was obviously pivotal to the finding that the merchant ships crew were within the jurisdiction of France.\n",
              "That control had no geographical dimension, at least not before the vessel was returned to France.\n",
              "But the very fact that the crew members were under the control of the French authorities, even before they arrived in France, was sufficient to bring them within French jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "If taking control of the crew members on the high seas is sufficient to bring them within the jurisdiction of France, it appears to me that where a state asserts and exercises exclusive control over the members of its own armed forces while they are in foreign territory, this must be an a fortiori instance of the extra territorial reach of the Convention.\n",
              "The prospect of the state owing article 2 obligations to its soldiers serving overseas is not the daunting one that the appellant in this case has portrayed.\n",
              "For the reasons explained by Lord Rodger in his judgment, the article 2 investigation conducted by means of a coroners inquest is not concerned with matters of policy or broad political decisions.\n",
              "The primary function of a coroners inquest is, as Lord Phillips has put it, to find facts rather than review policy.\n",
              "Lord Brown expresses concern that, if it is held that soldiers operating outside the espace juridique are within the jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1, Strasbourg will scrutinise a contracting states planning, control and execution of military operations to decide whether the states own forces have been subjected to excessive risk.\n",
              "I am afraid that, with great respect, I must disagree.\n",
              "The cases which prompted Lord Browns apprehension were Ergi v Turkey (1998) 32 EHRR 388, Isayeva, Yusupova and Bazayeva v Russia (Application Nos 57947 49/00) [2005] ECHR 129 and Isayeva v Russia (Application No 57950/00) [2005] ECHR 128.\n",
              "In the first of these cases, the Turkish security forces had set up an ambush in the vicinity of the village where the applicants sister lived, purportedly to capture members of the PKK.\n",
              "The applicant alleged that his sister had been killed by a bullet fired by members of the security forces in the course of an indiscriminate, retaliatory attack on the village, apparently carried out because the inhabitants had in the past harboured members of the PKK.\n",
              "Although the court felt unable to conclude that the applicants sister had been killed by a bullet fired by a member of the security forces or that the firing on the village was carried out in retaliation, as alleged, it decided that, even on the governments account of having laid an ambush for the PKK and having been involved in a fire fight with them, a violation of article 2 had been established.\n",
              "This was because insufficient precautions had been taken to protect the lives of the civilian population.\n",
              "It was also held that the investigation into the death was insufficient to satisfy the procedural requirements of article 2.\n",

              "The attack took place while the applicants were on what had been designated a humanitarian corridor.\n",
              "It was found that a large number of civilian vehicles were in the convoy when the attack took place.\n",
              "It was found that, even assuming that the military were pursuing a legitimate aim, the operation had not been planned and executed with sufficient care for the civilian population.\n",
              "In the final case the applicant claimed that she and her family were the victims of an air bombardment by Russian forces while trying to flee their village in Chechnya.\n",
              "It was established that heavy free falling, high explosive bombs and other non guided heavy combat weapons were used in the centre and on the edges of the applicants village.\n",
              "The avowed justification for this was that the civilian population was being held hostage by a large group of Chechen fighters.\n",
              "No attempt had been made to evacuate the village in advance and no steps had been taken to minimise the risk of injury to the civilian population.\n",
              "A breach of article 2 was found.\n",
              "The facts of these three cases are very far removed from the hypothetical example given by Lord Brown of courts embarking on scrutiny of planning, control and execution of military operations to decide whether a states own forces have been exposed to excessive risk.\n",
              "Lord Brown acknowledges that Strasbourgs concern in these cases was essentially for the safety of civilians caught up in conflict.\n",

              "As Lord Rodger has said, deaths and injuries of soldiers in a combat situation are inevitable.\n",

              "In this context, I should say that I agree entirely with Lord Rodgers observations in para 126 of his judgment.\n",
              "It will often be possible to suggest, after an event, measures that could have been taken that might have reduced the risk to a particular soldier but that type of retrospective analysis is surely inapposite (and will be recognised by courts as such) to address the question whether a states obligations to its soldiers under article 2 have been discharged.\n",
              "The duty to protect soldiers in a war setting is of an entirely different nature from the obligation to take proper steps to ensure that civilians are not exposed to unnecessary risks from military operations.\n",
              "I do not believe that the fear of tactical decisions taken in the field by military commanders being subject to painstaking dissection by the courts is justified or that it should deter this court from declaring that when our government commits our armed forces to wars in foreign territories, it cannot deny them the protection that the Convention affords.\n",

              "An inquest found that Private Smiths death was caused by a serious failure to address the difficulty he had in adjusting to the climate.\n",
              "Private Smiths mother commenced proceedings to quash that verdict and for a new inquest to be held.\n",
              "She argued that the United Kingdom had owed her son a duty to respect his right to life which was protected by article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and that the inquest had to satisfy the procedural requirements of an investigation into an alleged breach of that right.\n",
              "The Secretary of State denied that a further inquest was required on the facts of the case.\n",
              "He also denied that a soldier on military service abroad was subject to the protection of the Human Rights Act 1998 when outside his base, while accepting that in this case Private Smith had died within the UKs jurisdiction on the base.\n",
              "The High Court held that Private Smith had been protected by the Human Rights Act 1998 at all times in Iraq and ordered a fresh inquest.\n",
              "Before the Court of Appeal the Secretary of State agreed he would not submit to the new coroner that the requirements of article 2 were inapplicable.\n",
              "Notwithstanding that concession, both the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court considered that the appeal of the Secretary of State raised two issues of general importance and of practical concern: whether on the true interpretation of article 1 of the ECHR British troops operating on foreign soil fell within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom (the jurisdiction issue); and whether the fresh inquest into the death of Private Smith must conform with the procedural requirements implied into article 2 (the inquest issue).\n",
              "The Court of Appeal answered both questions in the affirmative.\n",
              "The Supreme Court allowed the appeal on the jurisdiction issue (Lady Hale, Lord Mance and Lord Kerr dissenting) and unanimously dismissed the appeal on the inquest issue.\n",
              "It held that it was not necessary in every case of a death of a serviceman abroad to carry out an investigation which examined whether there was fault on the part of the state because (a) the Human Rights Act 1998 did not apply to armed forces on foreign soil and (b) in any event, there was no such automatic right.\n",
              "The type of investigation would depend on the circumstances of the case.\n",
              "The jurisdiction issue Lord Phillips stated that the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg had held that jurisdiction within the meaning of article 1 was essentially territorial but extended in exceptional circumstances requiring special justification to other bases of jurisdiction.\n",
              "The difficulty lay in defining those exceptions [para 11].\n",
              "It was unlikely that the Contracting States, when they agreed the ECHR in 1951 in the aftermath of a global conflict in which millions of troops had been deployed, regarded it as desirable or practicable to extend the protection of article 2 to troop operations abroad [para 58].\n",
              "It was a novel suggestion that a states armed forces by reason of their personal status fell within the jurisdiction of the state when on foreign soil and the proper tribunal to resolve the issue was the Strasbourg Court itself [para 60].\n",
              "Lord Collins observed that in practice the exceptions recognised by the Strasbourg court had consisted of (i) territorial jurisdiction by a state over the territory of another contracting state; (ii) extensions of territorial jurisdiction by analogy and (iii) commonsense extensions of the notion of jurisdiction to fit cases which plainly should be within the scope of the ECHR [para 305].\n",
              "This case came within none of them.\n",
              "Jurisdiction could not be established simply on the basis of the UKs authority and control over them, nor were there policy grounds for extending the scope of the ECHR to armed forces abroad, which would ultimately involve the courts in issues relating to the conduct of armed hostilities which were essentially non justiciable [para 308].\n",
              "Lord Mance, dissenting, considered that as an occupying power in Iraq, the UK had under international law an almost absolute power over the safety of its forces.\n",
              "The relationship was not territorial but depended on a reciprocal bond of authority and control on the one hand and allegiance and obedience on the other [para 192].\n",
              "In his view the Strasbourg court would hold that the armed forces of a state were within the meaning of article 1 and for the purposes of article 2 wherever they might be [para 199].\n",
              "Lord Kerr agreed.\n",
              "If the state could export its jurisdiction by taking control of an area abroad it could equally do so when it took control of an individual.\n",
              "In his view this had already been recognised albeit obliquely by the Strasbourg court [para 331].\n",
              "The inquest issue Lord Phillips stated that where there was reason to suspect a substantive breach by the state of the article 2 right to life, it was established that the state of its own motion should carry out an investigation into the death which had certain features: a sufficient element of public scrutiny, conducted by an independent tribunal, involving the relatives of the deceased and which was prompt and effective [para 64].\n",
              "There was no automatic right to such an investigation whenever a member of the armed forces died on active service [para 84].\n",
              "The UK had a staged system of investigation into deaths.\n",
              "Some form of internal investigation would always be held into military deaths in service [para 85] and a public inquest was required whenever a body was brought back to this country.\n",
              "This would satisfy many of the procedural requirements of article 2.\n",
              "If, in the course of the inquest, it became apparent that there might have been a breach by the state of its positive article 2 obligations, this should, insofar as possible, be investigated and the result reflected in the coroners verdict, so as to satisfy the procedural requirements of article 2 [para 86].\n",
              "In Private Smiths case, the courts below were correct to hold that the coroner should have found a possibility that there had been a failure of the system to protect soldiers in extreme temperatures.\n",
              "It followed that the new inquest should comply with the procedural requirements of article 2 [paras 87 and 88].\n",
              "Lord Rodger considered that the Secretary of State had correctly conceded that an article 2 investigation was needed on the facts of this case but this was not always the position.\n",
              "The protection of the armed forces could never be complete; deaths and injuries were inevitable.\n",
              "It was for this very reason that the armed forces deserved and enjoyed the admiration of the community [para 122].\n",
              "It was contrary to the very essence of active military service to expect the authorities to ensure that troops would not be killed or injured by opposing forces [para 125].\n",
              "Furthermore, many issues of concern to the relatives of soldiers killed on active service raised questions of policy not legality, and would fall outside the scope of any investigation by a coroner [para 127].</td>\n",

              "Hereditament is a somewhat archaic conveyancing term which as a matter of ordinary legal terminology refers to any species of real property which would descend upon intestacy to the heirs at law: see section 205(1)(ix) of the Law of Property Act 1925.\n",

              "That means a property which is or may become liable to a rate, being a unit of such property which is, or would fall to be, shown as a separate item in the valuation list.\n",
              "The result, in the absence of further statutory definition, is that the meaning of hereditament is left to be elucidated by the courts in accordance with the principles underlying the rating Acts.\n",
              "The question which arises in a case like this is a very simple one.\n",
              "Given that non domestic rates are a tax on individual properties, what is the property in question? In principle, the fact that the same occupier holds two or more properties is irrelevant to the rateable status of any of them.\n",

              "If the law is to be rational and consistent, the circumstances in which a continuous territorial block is to be treated as several separate properties or in which geographically separate properties are to be treated as one for rating purposes, must be determined according to some ascertainable and defensible principle.\n",
              "There are two principles on which these questions might be decided.\n",
              "One is geographical and depends simply on whether the premises said to constitute a hereditament constitute a single unit on a plan.\n",
              "The other is functional and depends on the use that is or might be made of it.\n",
              "The distinction was first applied in a series of rating cases in Scotland, where the question was essentially the same as the one which arises on this appeal, namely whether property should be assessed for local rates as a number of distinct heritable subjects or as unum quid (one thing).\n",
              "These cases establish that the primary test is geographical, but that a functional test may in certain cases be relevant either to break up a geographical unit into several subjects for rating purposes or to unite geographically dispersed units in unum quid.\n",
              "By far the commonest application of the functional test is in derating cases.\n",
              "In these cases, the functional test serves to divide a single territorial block into different hereditaments where severable parts of it are used for quite different purposes.\n",
              "Thus a garage used in conjunction with a residence within the same curtilage will readily be treated as part of the same hereditament, whereas a factory within the same curtilage which is operated by the same occupier may not be.\n",
              "There are, however, rare cases in which function may also serve to aggregate geographically distinct subjects.\n",
              "It is with this latter question that the present appeal is concerned.\n",
              "In Bank of Scotland v Assessor for Edinburgh (1890) 17 R 839, the Lands Valuation Appeal Court dealt with a number of rating appeals involving banks with office premises used in conjunction with nearby residential premises occupied by bank employees.\n",
              "There were three categories of residential premises: (i) dwellings which were in buildings separate from the banks offices; (ii) dwellings which were under the same roof as the commercial offices with internal communication between them; and (iii) dwellings which were under the same roof but with no internal communication between them, or none that was in use.\n",
              "Lord Trayner held that in case (i) the dwellings fell to be valued separately while those in cases (ii) and (iii) were unum quid with the commercial offices.\n",
              "Lord Wellwood agreed with him on cases (i) and (ii), but not on case (iii) which he would have directed to be separately valued.\n",
              "However, the underlying principle applied by both judges was the same.\n",
              "They applied the geographical principle, distinguishing cases where the various bank buildings formed a continuous territorial block from cases where they did not.\n",
              "In those cases where the different buildings did not form a continuous territorial block, they could be treated as unum quid only where there was a necessary functional connection between them.\n",
              "Lord Trayner said at p 843: In the case of the Commercial Bank I think the assessor has gone wrong in including the messengers houses as part of the bank.\n",
              "These houses form no part of the bank buildings; they are separate houses in the adjoining street, no doubt sufficiently near to the bank to be convenient and suitable for the bank servants, but still no part of the bank buildings, and therefore no part of the unum quid.\n",
              "The assessor in support of the view he has adopted referred to the case of MJannet, 10 R 32, but I do not think that that case has any application here.\n",
              "It was decided in that case that the conservatory, stables, and outhouses connected with a dwelling house were not to be separately valued, but were to be regarded and valued as a unum quid.\n",
              "I agree entirely with that decision.\n",
              "The different parts of the subject to be valued lay together, and were within the one enclosure; they were the different parts which together went to make up the establishment.\n",
              "But although the stables, for example, were held in that case to be part of the residence and to be so valued, it does not follow that stables are in every case to be valued as part of the residence to which they are an accessory.\n",
              "The stables of a gentleman in town are as much a convenience or accessory to his town residence as they are in the case of a country house.\n",
              "They are not, however, valued along with the town residence, although situated in the adjoining street or mews.\n",
              "They are not so connected as they were in the case of a country mansion or residence as to make it impossible or difficult to let them separately.\n",
              "In the same way the Commercial Bank could not well retain their bank premises, and let the part thereof devoted to official residence, but they could quite well and conveniently let the messengers houses in the street to persons entirely unconnected with the bank.\n",
              "I think these houses therefore should be separately entered and valued in the Valuation roll.\n",
              "Lord Wellwood, at p 844, divided the residential buildings into three categories: First Those which are entirely detached from the bank buildings, as in the case of the messengers houses of the Commercial Bank of Scotland.\n",
              "I agree with Lord Trayner that the yearly value of those houses should be separately entered in the roll.\n",
              "Second The houses which form part of the main building, but have no internal communication with the business premises.\n",
              "I am of opinion that the yearly value of those dwelling houses also should be separately entered.\n",
              "The fact that they form part of the same building with the business premises is not I think in this question material, and was not much relied on by the respondent.\n",
              "Structurally they are self contained premises, and could be let separately if this were desired.\n",
              "The respondent relied mainly upon the consideration that the houses form necessary adjuncts to the bank premises, and together with them fell to be valued as a unum quid.\n",
              "Dwelling houses for bank officials connected with the bank premises are no doubt usual and useful additions to banking premises, but it is not indispensable that they should form part of the bank buildings, as is shewn in the case of the messengers houses of the Commercial Bank of Scotland.\n",
              "If, as is sometimes the case, it did not suit any of the officials to reside in the dwelling houses, they could be let to a tenant with no more danger to the bank than if they were under a different roof.\n",
              "The case seems to me to be precisely the same as that with which we are familiar of the lower flat of a dwelling house being converted into a shop with a separate entrance.\n",
              "The upper flats may or may not be occupied by the shopkeeper himself as a dwelling house, but I take it that in any case the dwelling house and the shop are valued separately.\n",
              "Third Dwelling houses which are connected by internal communication with the business premises.\n",
              "In regard to those I have more doubt.\n",
              "In their actual state they are at present connected with the business premises by an internal door of communication, which is used not merely as a convenient short cut by the occupant of the dwelling house, but also by other bank officials and servants for the purpose of locking the outer door of the bank and other purposes.\n",
              "This means of communication could be easily cut off by building up or even locking the door.\n",
              "But that is not the present state of matters, and the question being doubtful, I am not prepared to differ from the opinion of Lord Trayner and the Valuation Committee as to those dwelling houses.\n",
              "The point on which Lord Traynor and Lord Wellwood differed, concerning premises which were contiguous but did not interconnect arose for decision a year later in Bank of Scotland v Assessor for Edinburgh (1891) 18 R 936.\n",
              "Lord Wellwood, sitting with Lord Kyllachy, repeated his view that they fell to be separately valued.\n",
              "Lord Kyllachy, said, at p 938: The test I think here is whether the houses in question are capable, not merely physically but, all conditions being considered, of being separately let, and having a separate rent or value attached to them.\n",
              "As regards the house occupied by the messenger, and which has no internal communication with the rest of the bank, I agree with the opinion of Lord Wellwood at the last court.\n",
              "I see no reason, at least none appears in the case, why, if the bank chose, this house should not be separately let to a suitable tenant, or assigned by way of pension to an old servant, or otherwise dealt with as a separate and independent dwelling.\n",
              "In University of Glasgow v Assessor for Glasgow 1952 SC 504, the Lands Valuation Appeal Court held that various buildings of the University which were physically separate from the main buildings, capable of being separately let and dispersed among buildings belonging to other proprietors, were properly entered on the valuation roll as separate subjects.\n",
              "Lord Keith, delivering the judgment of the court, treated the first Bank of Scotland case as authority for the geographical principle (p 509).\n",
              "He said at p 510: The common enclosure in many cases supplies a useful basis, or test, for a unum quid entry.\n",
              "It is the reason why a villa with its garden ground, or a mansion house with its policies, and any ancillary buildings are entered as a unum quid.\n",
              "The geographical conception has never been lost sight of in making up entries in the Valuation Roll, and in the case of John Leng & Co v Assessor for Dundee Lord Sands took occasion twice to refer to the ordinary geographical arrangement followed in making up the Valuation Roll.\n",
              "There may be cases where geographical unity has to be departed from, as where premises within what would otherwise be a single entity are separately let, or lands or buildings within a common enclosure are used for separate purposes.\n",
              "It is not perhaps possible to lay down general rules for all cases.\n",
              "Something must depend on particular circumstances.\n",
              "But the broad general principles are as stated.\n",
              "Midlothian Assessor v Buccleuch Estates Ltd [1962] RA 257 concerned geographically separate parcels of woodland and sawmills on separate sites, which were operated as a single business.\n",
              "Lord Kilbrandon, sitting in the Lands Valuation Appeal Court, observed at p 268: It has never yet been admitted that you can have a unit of valuation consisting of widely scattered heritable subjects connected only by some functional or commercial nexus, and I do not see why it should be.\n",
              "I do not think one is being merely old fashioned or obscurantist in insisting, in the conception of unum quid, on a fairly close physical relationship between what might be considered as parts of a commercial unit; one is, after all, attempting to value not a business but heritable subjects, and it may be that the precedents, which all insist on such a physical relationship, indicate a determination to preserve that essential distinction.\n",
              "Not only do I know of no precedent in valuation practice which could justify a functional approach to the problem such as is here sought to be made, but I am still of opinion that no such approach can in this case give a proper content to the whole words of the statute.\n",
              "This statement was cited with approval by Lord Slynn of Hadley, delivering the only reasoned speech in the English valuation case of Hambleton District Council v Buxted Poultry Ltd [1993] AC 369, 378.\n",
              "More recently, in Burn Stewart Distillers plc v Lanarkshire Valuation Joint Board [2001] RA 110, the Lands Tribunal for Scotland held that premises under common occupation but situated on opposite sides of a main road constituted two hereditaments.\n",
              "The tribunal observed, at pp 140 141: We consider that the emphasis on the geographical test is an aspect of recognition that lands and heritages are physical subjects.\n",
              "The underlying purpose is to provide a proper basis for a tax on property, not a tax on persons or businesses.\n",
              "Where the subjects share characteristics of function which, in a robust practical sense, support the use of a single term to describe the physical subjects, they can be treated as one unit.\n",
              "On the other hand, we are satisfied that the fact that certain heritable subjects function together as one business will, by itself, be insufficient to demonstrate that they are to be regarded as a unum quid in any physical sense.\n",
              "A business is not a concept based on physical or heritable factors.\n",
              "Entry in the roll is based on identification of heritable subjects.\n",
              "The fact that one business may need to occupy two separate physical subjects does not change the character of the subjects.\n",
              "It is clear that undue emphasis on a business connection as evidence of functional connection between subjects could lead to a distinction for rating purposes between a business whose operating units were in close proximity and those whose operating units were, perhaps only slightly, more remote.\n",
              "There is no basis in legislation for such a distinction.\n",
              "We see no basis in fairness for it.\n",
              "We are not persuaded that there is a consistent practice which would lead to that result.\n",
              "If there is, we see no need to follow it.\n",
              "In the present case there is a clear physical separation of the two subjects.\n",
              "They each have a clear curtilage and these curtilages are separated by a public road and pavements.\n",
              "Although, in a sense, little different from the interposition of a public road, the fact that the ratepayers do not have exclusive occupation of the land which provides their access to that public road and the intermittent presence at their gate of large, slow moving vehicles belonging to another occupier, tends to enhance the impression of separation of the two subjects.\n",
              "A test based on appearance and impression may properly be treated as part of the geographical test.\n",
              "The two subjects have no unifying visual characteristics.\n",
              "There is nothing to indicate that they are operated together, far less that the physical presence of one is essential to the function of the other.\n",
              "Their physical characteristic as two distinct subjects is supported by the consideration that there is no real doubt that the subjects could be let separately.\n",
              "I derive from these decisions three broad principles relevant to cases like this one where the question is whether distinct spaces under common occupation form a single hereditament.\n",
              "First, the primary test is, as I have said, geographical.\n",
              "It is based on visual or cartographic unity.\n",
              "Contiguous spaces will normally possess this characteristic, but unity is not simply a question of contiguity, as the second Bank of Scotland case illustrates.\n",
              "If adjoining houses in a terrace or vertically contiguous units in an office block do not intercommunicate and can be accessed only via other property (such as a public street or the common parts of the building) of which the common occupier is not in exclusive possession, this will be a strong indication that they are separate hereditaments.\n",
              "If direct communication were to be established, by piercing a door or a staircase, the occupier would usually be said to create a new and larger hereditament in place of the two which previously existed.\n",
              "Secondly, where in accordance with this principle two spaces are geographically distinct, a functional test may nevertheless enable them to be treated as a single hereditament, but only where the use of the one is necessary to the effectual enjoyment of the other.\n",
              "This last point may commonly be tested by asking whether the two sections could reasonably be let separately.\n",
              "Third, the question whether the use of one section is necessary to the effectual enjoyment of the other depends not on the business needs of the ratepayer but on the objectively ascertainable character of the subjects.\n",
              "The application of these principles cannot be a mere mechanical exercise.\n",
              "They will commonly call for a factual judgment on the part of the valuer and the exercise of a large measure of professional common sense.\n",
              "But in my opinion they correctly summarise the relevant law.\n",
              "They are also rationally founded on the nature of a tax on individual properties.\n",
              "If the functional test were to be applied in any other than the limited category of cases envisaged in the second and third principles, a subject (or in English terms a hereditament) would fall to be identified not by reference to the physical characteristics of the property, but by reference to the business needs of a particular occupier and the use which, for his own purposes, he chose to make of it.\n",
              "One would not expect the law to be any different when the identical questions arise for decision in England.\n",
              "However, confusion has been caused by the leading English case, which is the decision of the Court of Appeal in Gilbert v S Hickinbottom and Sons Ltd [1956] 2 QB 40.\n",
              "The facts in this case were very similar to those in Burn Stewart Distillers.\n",
              "A large industrial bakery comprised a number of buildings in two blocks separated by a street.\n",
              "The Lands Tribunal held, overruling the valuation officer, that they constituted a single hereditament, and its decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\n",
              "Denning LJ held that geographically contiguous spaces were normally to be treated as one hereditament and geographically separate spaces as distinct, but that there were exceptional cases where their function required a different treatment.\n",
              "He gave as examples of the treatment of separate premises as one hereditament, the case where a road bisected a noblemans park, or agricultural land (in the days when agricultural land was rateable) or a golf course.\n",
              "The common feature of these cases, he thought (pp 49 50), was that the two properties on either side of the road are so essentially one whole by which I mean, so essential in use the one to another that they should be regarded as one single hereditament.\n",
              "Denning LJ appears to have derived this test from the decision in the University of Glasgow case, which he cited with approval.\n",
              "In my opinion his statement of the law was correct, although I would not necessarily endorse his examples, at any rate without more facts.\n",
              "The reason why Denning LJ nevertheless felt bound to dismiss the appeal was that the application of the test was a question of degree and therefore of fact (p 50), and if the Lands Tribunal thought that it was one hereditament they must have had their reasons.\n",
              "This seems a surprising conclusion on the facts recited in the report, but it has no bearing on the principle.\n",
              "Denning LJ was manifestly not suggesting that the Lands Tribunal was free to apply the test or not as they thought fit.\n",
              "The views of the other two judges are less clear.\n",
              "Morris LJ regarded it as undesirable to lay down general principles to govern what he regarded as a common sense assessment (p 52).\n",
              "The closest that he came to indicating in what circumstances geographically separate spaces might be regarded as a single hereditament was in the following passage, at p 52: buildings which, though not actually enclosed together or actually contiguous, are very near together and are not separated by the presence of other buildings and are being put to one common use may be regarded as comprising one hereditament.\n",
              "There can be no doubt that ordinarily very great weight will be placed upon what may be termed the geographical test.\n",
              "But the question is always one of fact and degree.\n",
              "The case before him he regarded as an exceptional one which depended on its particular facts (p 53), although it is not clear which particular facts made the difference, nor why.\n",
              "The third member of the court, Parker LJ, offered the following guidance, at pp 53 54: Whether or not premises in one occupation fall to be entered in the valuation list as one or more hereditaments depends upon a number of considerations.\n",
              "Without attempting an exhaustive list, the following considerations can be mentioned: (1) Whether the premises are in more than one rating area.\n",
              "If so, they must be divided into at least the same number of hereditaments as the rating areas in which the premises are situated. (2) Whether two or more parts of the premises are capable of being separately let.\n",
              "If not, then the premises must be entered as a single hereditament. (3) Whether the premises form a single geographical unit. (4) Whether though forming a single geographical unit the premises by their structure and layout consist of two or more separate parts. (5) Whether the occupier finds it necessary or convenient to use the premises as a whole for one purpose, or whether he uses different parts of the premises for different purposes.\n",
              "Whereas a consideration of questions (1) and (2) will in certain events conclude the matter one way or the other, the same does not, I think, result from a consideration of any one of the other questions alone.\n",
              "The conclusion, where the considerations of (1) and (2) are not decisive, must depend on the weight to be attached on the facts of each case to the other considerations.\n",
              "No doubt the most important of these other considerations is whether the premises form a geographical unit.\n",
              "Can they be ringed round on a map? Later, after citing the University of Glasgow case, he addressed the geographical and functional tests in the following terms, at pp 54 55: [The geographical test] is so often decisive that it is a convenient starting point to the inquiry, but it is not decisive in all cases.\n",
              "Thus, though the premises may form a geographical unit, the manner in which different parts are used may justify the premises being treated as several hereditaments; cf North Eastern Railway Co v Guardians of York Union [1900] 1 QB 733, 739 per Channell J.\n",
              "The appellants contention, however, is that though the functional test may justify treating a geographical unit as two hereditaments, it is wholly inapplicable where the premises occupied are geographically and structurally separate.\n",
              "There is no doubt, I think, that in the latter case little weight will ordinarily be given to any functional connexion, but it is another thing to say that it is irrelevant.\n",
              "If, as is admitted, a functional connexion is a relevant consideration when considering a geographical and structural unit, I fail to see why as a matter of law it cannot be considered at all when there are separate geographical and structural units.\n",
              "Each case must be considered on its particular facts, due weight being given to the degree and nature of the separation on the one hand and the importance of the functional connexion on the other.\n",
              "In these passages, Parker LJ clearly rejected the submission that function was irrelevant where premises were geographically separate.\n",
              "He was right to do so, because function may be relevant to the question whether separate premises must necessarily be enjoyed together, or are incapable of being reasonably let as separate units: see his proposition (2).\n",
              "Whether Parker LJ would have recognised the relevance of function to a case of geographically separate premises for any wider purpose is not clear.\n",
              "His proposition (5) suggests that he might have done, although he considered that even in such a case function was of little weight.\n",
              "In my opinion, the decision in Gilbert cannot be supported, at any rate on the grounds given, and the reasoning cannot be regarded as authority for very much.\n",
              "The only clear statement of principle is that of Denning LJ, which he does not appear to have applied.\n",
              "Mr Forsdick QC, the Advocate of the Court, submitted that the effect of the judgments of Morris LJ and Parker LJ was that it was for the tribunal of fact to determine not just the functional connection between separate premises, but the relevance of its conclusion on that point.\n",
              "I do not think that that clearly emerges from either judgment, but if it was indeed their view, then I respectfully disagree.\n",
              "Both the geographical and the functional principle require an evaluation of the facts by the tribunal of fact.\n",
              "However, the relationship between them is not itself a question of fact but a question of principle.\n",
              "The relevant principle is in my opinion summed up in the three propositions which I have extracted from the Scottish cases.\n",
              "The geographical test and the functional test are different and in some respects inconsistent.\n",
              "They cannot both operate in parallel unless there is some rational framework of principle for distinguishing their respective spheres.\n",
              "The English and the Scottish cases are agreed that the potential inconsistency is to be resolved by acknowledging the primacy of the geographical test and the subordinate character of the functional test.\n",
              "But what does this mean? The answer to the question must surely be supplied by the tribunal of law which posed it.\n",
              "To treat the relationship between these two incommensurate tests as no more than a question of fact and degree is to leave to the tribunal of fact what amounts to a discretion to give the functional test such weight as they choose as against the geographical one, and to allow the business choices of the occupier to determine the bounds of the hereditament.\n",
              "This would in turn make the basis of assessment more opaque and less consistent as between different occupiers.\n",
              "It would be a poor substitute for clear and principled rules, capable of uniform application.\n",
              "Until the present case came before the Valuation Tribunal and the President of the Lands Chamber, there had been no decision on how these principles were to be applied to cases in which the same occupier occupied different storeys within the same building.\n",
              "The only case which was arguably in point was British Railways Board v Hopkins (Valuation Officer) [1981] RA 328, in which the Lands Tribunal treated different storeys under common occupation as constituting a single hereditament, whether they were contiguous or not.\n",
              "But the decision turned on other issues and there was no discussion of this particular point.\n",
              "On the other hand, valuation officers had for some years adopted the practice of treating contiguous storeys under common occupation as one hereditament, but non contiguous storeys as distinct hereditaments.\n",
              "As far as the case law is concerned, this was therefore an unresolved question when the present case came before the Valuation Tribunal and then the President of the Lands Chamber.\n",
              "The President accepted Denning LJs formulation in Gilbert as applied to premises which were horizontally separated, in the sense that they were in different buildings or different territorial blocks.\n",
              "It will be apparent from what I have already said that I agree with him about this.\n",
              "But he thought that premises which were in the same building but were vertically separated were different.\n",
              "At para 20, he observed: I agree with Mr Woolway, and with the submissions made by Mr Kolinsky on the point, that in identifying hereditaments within a modern office building the concept of the curtilage has no useful part to play, and is far removed from what Denning LJ had in mind when formulating his general rules in Gilbert v Hickinbottom.\n",
              "The Valuation Tribunal, having concluded that the two floors were within the same curtilage, then explored whether there was an essential: functional link between them.\n",
              "In so doing it was clearly misapplying Denning LJs general rules, where the question of the essential functional link only arose in the case of premises that were not within the same curtilage but were separated by a highway, and I do not think that an essential connection should be treated as a criterion in the present case.\n",
              "I agree in any event with the Valuation Officer that a detailed inquiry into the functional relationship between parts of a building in the same occupation is of no assistance in the present case and is positively undesirable.\n",
              "It seems to me inappropriate to explore the degree of functional interaction between two floors in common occupation.\n",
              "Any such process would tend to be detailed and time consuming (as it was in the present case) and always liable to reassessment as the occupier made changes in the way that the space was utilised.\n",
              "The fact that the floors of office premises are in the same occupation for the purposes He concluded, at para 29: of the occupying firm is by itself; in my judgment, a significant pointer.\n",
              "The proper approach in a case such as this, therefore, in my judgment, is to treat the floors occupied within the building by the same occupier as a single hereditament.\n",
              "Since the occupier will be occupying the floors as offices for the purposes of his business, it is not in my view necessary to investigate the functional interrelationship between the floors at any particular time.\n",
              "In the present case, therefore, floors two and six are properly to be entered as a single hereditament, as the Valuation Tribunal determined; and the Valuation Officers appeal on this point fails.\n",
              "In effect, therefore, the President applied neither a geographical test nor a functional one.\n",
              "He declined to ask himself whether the possession of both storeys was necessary to the enjoyment of either, nor whether they could be let separately, nor whether they intercommunicated (the answers would clearly have been No, Yes and No respectively).\n",
              "He quite rightly regarded the way in which a particular occupier chose to use the premises together as irrelevant.\n",
              "Yet at the same time he considered that when separate premises were located in the same building, it was wrong to apply a geographical test either.\n",
              "He therefore declined to ask himself Parker LJs question, whether the alleged single hereditament could be ringed round on a plan (the answer would have been No).\n",
              "The President of the Lands Chamber was labouring under the difficulty that he was bound by Gilbert, and therefore obliged to make more sense of it than the judgments really permit.\n",
              "At any rate, I am unable to accept his reasoning.\n",
              "It introduces an arbitrary distinction between horizontal and vertical separation which responds to no discernible principle.\n",
              "In order to pass from level 2 to level 6, it is necessary to leave the demised premises on level 2, enter the common parts over which Mazars had a licence but no right of possession, and to ascend in a lift to the common parts on level 6 before entering the other premises.\n",
              "This is no different, either geographically or functionally, from leaving a building which is exclusively occupied by the ratepayer, crossing land belonging to someone else and entering another building under the same occupation.\n",
              "The President remarks that the lifts were fast and the move from one level to the other simple, but why should that be any more relevant than the fact that the separate building was only a short distance away or could be reached at high speed by car? In my opinion there is no rational reason to regard Denning LJs test as any less applicable to distinct premises within the same building than it is to different buildings within the same urban park.\n",
              "It is clear that the President was strongly influenced by the Valuation Officers acceptance that vertically or horizontally contiguous spaces in the same building fall to be treated as one hereditament, so that if Mazars had occupied levels 2 and 3, instead of levels 2 and 6, the result would have been different.\n",
              "This concession, as I have pointed out, is not necessarily correct unless the two spaces directly intercommunicate.\n",
              "For present purposes, however, it is enough to note that there is nothing anomalous about the notion that the result is different when the spaces are not contiguous and do not directly intercommunicate.\n",
              "It simply shows that the same occupier has two distinct taxable properties, just as he would have if they were on opposite sides of the street.\n",
              "For these reasons I would allow the Valuation Officers appeal, set aside the orders of the Valuation Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal and declare that the premises demised to Mazars on the second and sixth storeys of Tower Bridge House are to be entered in the rating lists as separate hereditaments.\n",
              "LORD GILL: (who agrees with Lord Sumption)\n",
              "I agree that this appeal should be allowed.\n",
              "It seems that in this case the decision whether the ratepayers premises constitute one hereditament or two does not affect the overall value of them; but in other cases the effect of the decision may be significant (eg Trunkfield (Valuation Officer) v Camden London Borough Council [2011] RA 1).\n",
              "The appeal is important from that practical point of view; but its principal importance is that it requires us to examine, in a modern context, the principles by which the hereditament is to be identified, and to do so in a case that does not involve de rating.\n",
              "The Valuation Tribunal for England (VTE) held that the premises were a single hereditament on the view that the two floors were within a single curtilage and that the integrated use of them was essential to the efficiency of the ratepayers business as a whole.\n",
              "In the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) the President (Mr George Bartlett QC) agreed with the decision of the VTE, subject to a reduction of the valuation; but he took a different approach.\n",
              "He was not persuaded that the essential functional link between the two parts, on which the VTE had relied, should be the criterion.\n",
              "He considered that a detailed inquiry into such a question would be positively undesirable (para 20).\n",
              "He considered it significant that the two floors were in single occupation, and that in the context of a modern office building the concept of the curtilage had no place.\n",
              "His decision turned on the facts relating to the physical nature of the premises and the purposes for which the ratepayer occupied them, there being no significant difference from the occupiers point of view between floors that were adjoining and floors that were separated.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal against that decision, essentially for the reasons given by the President of the Tribunal.\n",
              "The decision of the Court of Appeal in Gilbert v S Hickinbottom and Sons Ltd [1956] 2 QB 40 has been central to this case.\n",
              "It has stood for nearly 60 years.\n",
              "The effect of it was that premises of different kinds situated on opposite sides of a highway were to be regarded as one hereditament where the ratepayer had integrated its use of one with its use of the other.\n",
              "It is plainly an unsatisfactory decision.\n",
              "There is no common thread of reasoning in the opinions of the three judges.\n",
              "I cannot understand why Denning LJ (as he then was), who clearly favoured the geographical test and found three cases based on it that commended themselves to his mind, one of them being the Glasgow University case [1952] SC 504, deferred to the conclusion of the Lands Tribunal to the contrary effect, especially when it was not clear to him why the Tribunal had distinguished those cases from the case that was under appeal.\n",
              "In the result, the Gilbert decision has been understood to mean that whether separate premises constitute a single hereditament may depend on the use to which the ratepayer puts them: in short, that geographical separation may in some circumstances be outweighed by functional integration.\n",
              "The Gilbert case was decided on the definition of hereditament in section 68 of the Rating and Valuation Act 1925 (the 1925 Act); namely: any lands, tenements, hereditaments or property which are or may become liable to any rate in respect of which the valuation list is by this Act made conclusive In section 115(1) of the General Rate Act 1967 (the 1967 Act), which now applies, hereditament means property which is or may become liable to a rate, being a unit of such property which is, or would fall to be, shown as a separate item in the valuation list.\n",
              "Counsel for the valuation officer suggested that that the Gilbert decision should be distinguished because it was decided on the definition of hereditament in the 1925 Act, which in counsels submission was materially different from the present definition.\n",
              "I do not accept that.\n",
              "The 1967 Act was a consolidating measure.\n",
              "It was reasonable in such a consolidation to recast the former definition, which suffered from circularity.\n",
              "In my view the reference to a unit of property which is, or would fall to be, shown as a separate item in the valuation list simply means a unit of property that would constitute a separate hereditament in accordance with established legal principles.\n",
              "I agree with the Court of Appeal on this point.\n",
              "If I am right in the view that section 115(1) has not changed the law on the point, it follows that the decision in Gilbert cannot be side stepped in this way.\n",
              "The real point on which the Gilbert case should be distinguished is that it concerned industrial de rating.\n",
              "In Gilbert and in the other de rating cases that have been referred to in this appeal, it was to the advantage of the ratepayer if ancillary but separate premises could be said to be part of one hereditament.\n",
              "If they were, the benefit of de rating was applied to the whole.\n",
              "Inevitably in such cases ratepayers emphasised the functional connection.\n",
              "The influence of that consideration is immediately apparent in the Gilbert case and, in similar circumstances, in the Scottish case of John Leng and Co v Assessor for Dundee 1929 SC 315.\n",
              "It can also be seen in the unsuccessful argument for the ratepayer in the Glasgow University case, where the University enjoyed partial exemption from local rates.\n",
              "De rating cases are not concerned with valuation for rating.\n",
              "They are about the remission of a liability for rates based on the use that the ratepayer makes of the property.\n",
              "On the other hand, valuation for rating is concerned with physical premises.\n",
              "It cannot be right that geographically separate premises should be valued as one hereditament simply because the ratepayer chooses to link his use of one with his use of the other.\n",
              "To modify the geographical test with considerations of functionality, in this sense of the word, is to add to a clear and objective test the uncertainty of a test that is dependent on whatever happens to be the ratepayers choice of use.\n",
              "Numerous cases have been referred to by counsel for the appellant and by the amicus that purport to apply the Gilbert decision.\n",
              "It would be an unprofitable exercise to go through them one by one.\n",
              "They merely demonstrate the various approaches that courts and tribunals have taken in the attempt to deduce a coherent principle from the Gilbert case.\n",
              "Notable among these cases is Trunkfield (Valuation Officer) v Camden London Borough Council [2011] RA 1.\n",
              "It concerned two adjoining office buildings.\n",
              "The ratepayers occupied one building in its entirety.\n",
              "In the other, they occupied the third, fifth and sixth floors and part of the fourth.\n",
              "In the valuation list there was a single assessment for the first building and four separate assessments for the floors occupied by the ratepayers in the other building.\n",
              "The Valuation Tribunal determined that the five assessments should be merged.\n",
              "In his appeal to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) the valuation officer contended that there should be two assessments, one for the first building and one for the four floors occupied in the other.\n",
              "The President allowed the appeal and directed that the list should be amended as the valuation officer proposed.\n",
              "If, as I assume, there were no means of internal communication between any of the four floors in the second building, the question in this appeal would have arisen; but in the event the valuation officers position precluded any discussion of that question.\n",
              "In my view the valuation officers position was unsound.\n",
              "Section 67 of the 1967 Act requires the valuation officer inter alia to maintain a valuation list for each rating area in accordance with the provisions of Part V of the Act.\n",
              "In Scotland, the equivalent obligation of the assessor is to make up a valuation roll listing all of the lands and heritages in his valuation area (Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975, section 1).\n",
              "The expression lands and heritages dates back to the Lands Valuation (Scotland) Act 1854 (17 & 18 Vict c 91).\n",
              "Although the law of valuation for rating is governed in Scotland by different legislation, the essential point is identical in both jurisdictions.\n",
              "It is to identify the unit of valuation.\n",
              "In my view, there is no reason why the two jurisdictions should diverge on the principles of the matter.\n",
              "On the contrary, it is desirable that they should coincide.\n",
              "In the law of Scotland, the identification of the valuation unit, or the unum quid, rests on a geographical test.\n",
              "The history of the matter begins with the decision of the Lands Valuation Appeal Court in Bank of Scotland v Assessor for Edinburgh (1890) 17 R 839.\n",
              "That case concerned a number of bank buildings and the associated dwellinghouses of the staff who worked in them.\n",
              "In some cases, those in the third category referred to by Lord Sumption (para 7) the dwellinghouse was part of the bank building itself, but had no internal means of communication with the bank premises.\n",
              "Lord Trayner thought that in those cases the whole building should be valued as a unum quid.\n",
              "Lord Wellwood thought that the dwellinghouse and the bank premises should be valued as separate lands and heritages.\n",
              "In the following year, the Lands Valuation Appeal Court reconsidered the case.\n",
              "On that occasion the court, consisting of Lord Wellwood and Lord Kyllachy, decided that where the bank premises and the staff dwellinghouse were not internally connected, they should be entered in the roll as separate lands and heritages (Bank of Scotland v Assessor for Edinburgh (1891) 18 R 936).\n",
              "In my view, that was correct.\n",
              "The absence of an internal connection between the residential unit and the bank premises meant that to reach the bank the occupier of the dwellinghouse had to leave the building and go by the street to the public entrance of the bank.\n",
              "The question arose again in Glasgow University v Assessor for Glasgow 1952 SC 504.\n",
              "In that case the ratepayer, in seeking the benefit of partial de rating, argued that there should be a single entry in the roll comprehending the main University buildings as planned and built as such, and with later additions; together with a diverse group of peripheral University buildings dispersed among the buildings of other proprietors.\n",
              "This last group included, for example, a laboratory and a reading room that was on a separate site on the other side of a main road.\n",
              "The Lands Valuation Appeal Court concluded that the main buildings lay within the University enclosure proper, being structurally and geographically part of a common whole, and should be entered in the roll as a unum quid.\n",
              "On the other hand it considered that while the peripheral buildings were functionally part of the University, they were geographically separate and should be entered as separate lands and heritages.\n",
              "That decision reaffirmed the primacy of the geographical test.\n",
              "The geographical test was strictly applied by the Lands Valuation Appeal Court in Edinburgh Merchant Co Education Board v Assessor for Lothian 1982 SC 129 in a case where two schools on opposite sides of a main road had come to be occupied as one.\n",
              "One set of buildings was situated in playing fields.\n",
              "The other was in a set of converted terraced houses.\n",
              "Access from one to the other was by a path over a railway bridge and a lane.\n",
              "Although they were occupied as a functional unit, the court concluded that there was no geographical unum quid.\n",
              "The Glasgow University case and the Gilbert case were considered by the Lands Tribunal for Scotland in Burn Stewart Distillers plc v Lanarkshire Valuation Joint Board [2001] RA 110.\n",
              "In that case the ratepayer contended that there should be a single entry in the roll for premises situated on opposite sides of a main road.\n",
              "On one side the premises consisted of warehousing and the main office accommodation.\n",
              "On the other, there was a whisky bottling complex and distribution plant with ancillary storage space and small proportion of office and cloakroom space.\n",
              "On this side there was a canteen used by staff from both premises.\n",
              "Materials were moved between the two premises by fork lift trucks which traversed the public road.\n",
              "A concrete communications conduit linking the two premises ran under the main road.\n",
              "The main office accommodation constituted the head office of the ratepayer and dealt with many matters unrelated to the bottling and distribution plant, including worldwide marketing.\n",
              "The Tribunal, chaired by Lord McGhie, applied the geographical test and held that it was not satisfied.\n",
              "The Burn Stewart decision was referred to in argument in Trunkfield (Valuation Officer) v Camden London Borough Council (supra); but was not referred to in the judgment.\n",
              "I agree with the three general principles that have been stated by Lord Sumption (at para 12).\n",
              "It is important to emphasise that the reference to functionality in the second and third of these principles is not a reference to the use that the ratepayer chooses to make of the premises.\n",
              "It is a reference to a necessary interdependence of the separate parts that is objectively ascertainable.\n",
              "For example, such an interdependence is to be found between a tourist attraction in a castle and the associated gift shop in the castle grounds (Roxburghe Estates v Assessor for Scottish Borders Council [2004] RA 15).\n",
              "Conversely, functionality in this sense may also be relevant where premises that are apparently geographically linked are wholly dissociated; for example, the hotel and the engine sheds at a railway station (North Eastern Railway Co v Guardians of York Union [1900] 1 QB 733).\n",
              "To the three general principles that Lord Sumption has laid down, I would add only the comment that in the application of them, the concept of fairness, alluded to in this case by the President of the Tribunal, has no place.\n",
              "In my opinion, these general principles provide straightforward and workable guidance that is consistent with the underlying theory of rating law that rates are a tax on a ratepayers property and not on a ratepayers business (Midlothian Assessor v Buccleuch Estates Ltd [1962] RA 257, Lord Kilbrandon at p 268).\n",
              "It was suggested on behalf of the valuation officer that in the application of the geographical test the decisive criterion is contiguity.\n",
              "That is an extreme position that I do not accept.\n",
              "Properties that are discontiguous but nonetheless geographically linked, may constitute one hereditament if the occupation of one part would be pointless without the occupation of the other.\n",
              "The Glasgow University case is an example.\n",
              "In that case it was clearly right that an assemblage of academic buildings constituting the core of the university campus should be valued as a unum quid.\n",
              "Roxburghe Estates v Assessor for Scottish Borders Council (supra) is another example.\n",
              "In that case the lands and heritages consisted of exhibition rooms within a castle with an adjacent gift shop and restaurant, a coffee shop and parts of the gardens and ground.\n",
              "The gift shop and the restaurant owed their existence to the castle; whereas the coffee shop was situated outside the pay wall and had an independent existence that linked it more closely with a nearby garden centre.\n",
              "It was not part of the unum quid.\n",
              "On the facts of the present case, I fail to see why premises on separate floors of a building, where the only access from one to the other is through the common parts, should be regarded as one hereditament.\n",
              "In reaching that view, the President has misdirected himself.\n",
              "He has lost sight of the geographical test.\n",
              "He has been influenced by the use that the present occupier has chosen to make of the premises and has introduced an irrelevant and confusing consideration of fairness.\n",
              "It was suggested in the discussion in this case that if the two parts of the office had been on adjacent floors they could have been treated as one hereditament on the view that they were contiguous in the vertical rather than the horizontal plane.\n",
              "That, in my view, is a contrived argument.\n",
              "The disjunction of the two parts of the ratepayers offices lies in the fact that the only access between them is through the public part of the building.\n",
              "The same disjunction would apply even if they were on adjacent floors.\n",
              "In that event, I would have taken the view that they remained separate hereditaments.\n",
              "LORD NEUBERGER: (who agrees with Lord Sumption and Lord Gill)\n",
              "I add a few words of my own, partly because we are disagreeing with the experienced and respected President of the Lands Chamber, whose decision was unanimously upheld by the Court of Appeal, and partly because I have found this a difficult point in the light of the unsatisfactory state of the English and Welsh case law.\n",
              "This case concerns the issue whether two physically separate pieces of property, namely the second and sixth floors of an office building, can be a single hereditament for rating purposes because they are occupied by, and let to, the same person in connection with the same business.\n",
              "The statutory definition of hereditament in section 115(1) of the General Rate Act 1967 states that it is such a unit of property which is, or would fall to be, shown as a separate item in the valuation list.\n",
              "While, at least to some extent, that is a circular definition, it does contain the expression unit of property, which carries with it the notion of a single piece of property, what in Scots law is called unum quid.\n",
              "And, in that connection, I entirely agree that there should be no difference of approach between Scottish and English law on the issue raised on this appeal.\n",
              "Normally at any rate, both as a matter of ordinary legal language and as a matter of judicial observation, a hereditament is a self contained piece of property (ie property all parts of which are physically accessible from all other parts, without having to go onto other property), and a self contained piece of property is a single hereditament.\n",
              "As the Scottish Lands Tribunal said in Burn Stewart Distillers plc v Lanarkshire Valuation Joint Board [2001] RA 110, 140, the emphasis on the geographical test is an aspect of recognition that lands and heritages are physical subjects.\n",
              "Thus, two separate self contained buildings, even if sharing a common wall, would not be expected to be a single hereditament but two hereditaments.\n",
              "And a building no part of which was self contained would be expected to be a single hereditament.\n",
              "At first sight, it might appear that whether certain premises constitute one hereditament or two hereditaments should not depend on how those premises are occupied.\n",
              "To quote again from Burn Stewart, [a] business is not a concept based on physical or heritable factors (p 141).\n",
              "Of course, occupation is traditionally a central issue in rating law, but at least primarily for the purpose of determining who, if anyone, is in rateable occupation.\n",
              "On the face of it, however, it may be thought that there should be no logical connection between the identification of the boundaries or extent of a hereditament and the identification of the rateable occupier of that hereditament.\n",
              "Nonetheless, on further reflection, it can be seen that the occupation of premises can in some circumstances serve to control their status as one or more hereditaments.\n",
              "An office building let to and occupied by a single occupier would be a single hereditament, but if the freeholder let each floor of the building to a different occupying tenant, retaining the common parts for their common use, then each floor would be a separate hereditament.\n",
              "Furthermore, it is well established that premises are not merely liable to have their rateable value assessed, but also to have their status as a hereditament assessed, by reference to the machinery, plant and other structures which have been placed in or on them, whether by the occupier or someone else, sometimes even if the structure retains its character as a chattel see per Lord Radcliffe in London County Council v Wilkins (Valuation Officer) [1957] AC 362, 378.\n",
              "The problem thrown up by this appeal is how far what I have described as the normal position in para 47 above, ie what Lord Gill has called the geographical test, should be modified by a particular occupational arrangement.\n",
              "In my view, that question should, if possible, be answered in a way which is not only principled, but which is as clear and practical as possible.\n",
              "That is because Valuation Officers and others concerned with rating are entitled to expect to know what approach to adopt when such an issue arises, and the approach should be one which is tolerably easy to apply.\n",
              "However, as is not unusual, clarity and practicality are to some extent in conflict, and, unsurprisingly in the complex and multi faceted world of land and buildings, there cannot be complete certainty.\n",
              "Where premises consist of two self contained pieces of property, it would, in my view, require relatively exceptional facts before they could be treated as a single hereditament.\n",
              "The mere fact that each property may have the same occupier should, at least normally, make no difference.\n",
              "As Lord Keith said in Glasgow University v Assessor for Glasgow 1952 SC 504, 509, [i]n the ordinary case the question whether separate buildings, or parts of buildings, should be entered in the Roll as unum quid falls to be decided primarily from the geographical standpoint.\n",
              "However, it is possible to conceive of facts which would justify a different conclusion.\n",
              "Thus, if one property could not sensibly be occupied or let other than together with the other property, I think that the two properties could, and indeed normally should, be properly treated as a single hereditament.\n",
              "As Lord Keith went on to say in Glasgow University at p 510, quoting Lord Trayner in Bank of Scotland v Assessor for Edinburgh (1890) 17 R 839, 843, for two separate properties to be treated as a single hereditament, it is not enough that one of the properties is a convenience or accessory for the other: it would have to be impossible or difficult to let them separately.\n",
              "Strict necessity is not the test.\n",
              "As Lord Sumption says, his three tests set out in para 12 (with which I agree) have to be applied with professional common sense to the facts of each case.\n",
              "A golf course, a shipyard, a distillery or a factory which is, in each case, divided by a public road could properly be treated as a single hereditament.\n",
              "These are all examples given in the decision of the Lands Tribunal for Scotland in Burn Stewart Distillers plc v Assessors for Lanarkshire Valuation Joint Board [2001] RA 110, where it was rightly said that, while the fact that certain heritable subjects function together as one business will, by itself, be insufficient to demonstrate that they are to be regarded as a unum quid in any physical sense, [i]t is impossible to lay down clear rules which will apply in all cases.\n",
              "The Lands Tribunal also suggested that, while physical separation of subjects would normally prevent them from being a single hereditament (to use the English expression), [w]here the subjects share characteristics of function which, in a robust practical sense, support the use of a single term to describe the physical subjects, they can be treated as one unit (p 141).\n",
              "That is well illustrated by the unreported 1982 Scottish case of Lothian Regional Council v Assessor for Lothian Region whose effect is summarised in these terms in Armour on Valuation for Rating (looseleaf, August 2014 ed), para 10 05: [I]t was held to be competent for the assessor to make a single composite entry in the roll in respect of 923 bus shelters maintained by the appellants throughout the region, where the work involved in making separate entries would have been very onerous and unnecessary, there being no suggestion of any prejudice suffered by the appellants as a result.\n",
              "The cases summarised in the English text book Ryde on Rating and the Council Tax (looseleaf, July 2014 ed), paras C 210 and 211, suggest that the most frequent type of case where the question of whether two separate properties are to be treated as a single hereditament arises in connection with industrial or retail premises.\n",
              "Rydes summary of the effect of those cases also suggests that, on the current understanding of the law, the question is one to which the answer is unpredictable following the unfortunate decision of the Court of Appeal in Gilbert v S Hickinbottom & Sons Ltd [1956] 2 QB 40 (which I shall discuss in more detail below).\n",
              "Indeed, the question is almost treated as an issue of discretion for each first instance tribunal, which is an approach that is both unprincipled and unclear.\n",
              "The Scottish cases cited in Armour demonstrate a far more satisfactory state of affairs.\n",
              "There is a risk, as I have mentioned, of being too prescriptive in generalising about an issue which, as a matter of fact, can apply to cases which are rather different from the present case (which of course concerns floors in an office building).\n",
              "However, it seems to me that a principled approach to all premises, whether used or recorded as office, retail, industrial, warehouse, recreational or any other purpose, which accords with the law as I understand it to have been laid down in Scottish courts, is as follows.\n",
              "In order to decide whether two separate self contained units of property constitute a single hereditament, one does not so much look at the actual occupation or actual use of those properties, although that might provide useful evidence in some marginal cases.\n",
              "Rather one looks at the relationship between the two properties, as discussed in paras 51 53 above.\n",
              "And, when considering the two properties in this connection, one takes into account the plant, machinery, and other fixtures (including some chattels) which form part of the property for all rating purposes see the London County Council case cited above.\n",
              "In my opinion, two separate self contained floors in the same office building, whether or not they are contiguous, cannot be said to satisfy such a test, at least in the absence of very unusual facts.\n",
              "Once they cease to be self contained, because, say, an internal means of access (eg an internal staircase) is constructed, so that each floor is accessible from the other without going onto other property eg the common parts of the building then the two hereditaments will normally be treated as have been converted into one larger hereditament.\n",
              "Unless there is such a means of access, each floor is self contained from the other, and each can be occupied and let independently of the other.\n",
              "Accordingly, I can see no good reason why they should be treated as a single hereditament merely because they happen to be let to and occupied by the same tenant.\n",
              "It is true that they are in the same building, but it is hard to see why a different result should obtain if, for instance, the respondents had occupied the second floor of Tower Bridge House and the sixth floor of an adjoining building.\n",
              "The courts below considered that it was artificial and unfair to treat two self contained floors in common occupation in the same building differently depending on whether or not they were at consecutive levels.\n",
              "There is considerable force in that, but their error was to assume that the two floors should be treated as a single hereditament if they were at consecutive levels.\n",
              "As explained, if they are each self contained from the other, then, absent very unusual facts, they should be separate hereditaments.\n",
              "Furthermore, closer consideration suggests that, particularly in modern buildings, two consecutive floors are not actually contiguous to each other: there will often be a void between them, which contains servicing equipment and is in the possession and occupation of the landlord of the building.\n",
              "Absent a communicating internal staircase or lift, passing through the void, two consecutive floors in the same building would be physically separated in much the same way as two non consecutive floors.\n",
              "I do not doubt that there will be cases where the guidance given on this appeal will be difficult to apply with any confidence.\n",
              "However, it is hard to believe that we will be leaving the law of England and Wales on this topic in a less satisfactory state than it was as a result of Gilbert, although it is only fair to add that the judgments in that case contain some accurate and helpful dicta.\n",
              "At p 50, Denning LJ correctly expressed approval of earlier Lands Tribunal cases where it had been held that properties on different sides of the road in the same occupation should normally be assessed as separate hereditaments.\n",

              "In Gilbert, Denning LJ also stated the correct test, namely where the two properties so essential in use the one to another that they should be regarded as one single hereditament (pp 49 50); however, that test is to be assessed objectively and not by reference to the needs or use of the particular occupier, and it is by no means clear to me that Denning LJ was saying that.\n",
              "Morris LJ at p 52 seems to have thought that the actual use was important, but it is not clear what weight he thought it should be given, although it led him to join in wrongly dismissing the appeal.\n",
              "Parker LJ set out a number of factors at pp 53 54, and (correctly) said that if premises consist of two properties which are not capable of being separately let , then the premises must be entered as a single hereditament.\n",
              "However, he also identified a number of other factors, which may be of more questionable value, as is supported by the fact that he also wrongly joined in dismissing the appeal.\n",

              "At best, it is an unhelpful decision, and the actual result was wrong: the appeal should have been allowed.\n",
              "The Scottish cases, which are more fully considered by Lord Sumption and Lord Gill, are far more satisfactory, and, as Lord Gill says, it is very hard to understand how Denning LJs approval of them can be reconciled with his dismissing the appeal in Gilbert.\n",

              "Three broad principles apply in answering this question.\n",
              "The primary test is geographical, being based on visual or cartographic unity.\n",
              "Contiguous spaces will normally possess this characteristic, but unity is not simply a question of contiguity.\n",
              "If contiguous units do not intercommunicate and can be accessed via other property of which the common occupier is not in exclusive possession, this will be a strong indication that they are separate hereditaments.\n",
              "Second, where two spaces are geographically distinct, a functional test may nevertheless enable them to be treated as a single hereditament, but only where the use of the one is necessary to the effectual enjoyment of the other.\n",
              "Third, the question whether the use of one section is necessary to the effectual enjoyment of the other depends not on the business needs of the ratepayer but on the objectively ascertainable character of the premises.\n",
              "This calls for a factual judgment on the part of the valuer, exercising professional common sense [12].\n",
              "In the present case neither a geographical nor a functional test was applied [20].\n",
              "The appeal is allowed therefore.\n",

              "In his concurring judgment, Lord Gill emphasises that the reference to functionality in the tests articulated by Lord Sumption does not refer to the use which the ratepayer chooses to make of the premises.\n",
              "Rather, it is a reference to the necessary interdependence of the separate parts of the property that is objectively ascertainable [39].\n",
              "The concept of fairness has no place in the application of the three principles laid down by Lord Sumption, which provide straightforward and workable guidance [40].\n",
              "Contiguity is not the decisive criterion in the geographical tests.\n",
              "Properties that are discontinguous but geographically linked may constitute one hereditament if the occupation of one part would be pointless without the occupation of the other [41].\n",
              "The discontiguity between the offices in question lies in the fact that the only access between them is through the public part of the building, not whether they are vertically or horizontally adjacent [43].\n",
              "Lord Neuberger, concurring with Lord Sumption and Lord Gill, concludes that a hereditament is a self contained piece of property, namely all parts of which are physically accessible from all other parts, without having to go onto other property [47].\n",
              "Where premises consist of two self contained pieces of property it would require relatively exceptional facts before they could be treated as a single hereditament.\n",

              "The principal elements were: 521 residential units and a 90 apartment retirement village at Farthingloe; 31 residential units and a hotel and conference centre at Western Heights; and conversion of the Drop Redoubt into a visitor centre and museum.\n",
              "A payment of 5m for the improvements to heritage assets, to be funded from the profits of the residential development, was to be secured by a planning agreement.\n",

              "The report, under the name of the Head of Regeneration and Development, is a remarkable document.\n",
              "It runs to some 135 pages with appendices.\n",
              "It contains a comprehensive exposition of the various elements of the proposed development, the responses to consultation public and private, and the applicable national and local policies, followed by a detailed appraisal of the relevant issues, and concluding with a recommendation for the grant of permission but in amended form.\n",
              "The principal change recommended by the officers was the exclusion from the development at Farthingloe of a safeguarded area of some 2ha in the south west (in the more prominent sector known as FL B), where officers consider the landscape harm most acute; and the consequent reduction of the number of houses at Farthingloe from 521 to 365.\n",
              "The Councils economic advisers, Smiths Gore, had advised that the reduction would not jeopardise the viability of the scheme or the intended financial contributions (officers report paras 2.216, 2.443, 2.445).\n",
              "One aspect of Smiths Gores advice was to suggest a reduction in the Code for Sustainable Homes (CSH) rating from Code 4 to Code 3, which would not only deliver a viable development but would also achieve a more marketable and higher quality housing scheme this being important to help diversify and improve the Dover housing offer (paras 2.217, 2.443).\n",
              "Among other recommended conditions, it was proposed that the provision of the hotel should be secured by requiring it to be commenced before one of the development phases (para 2.131(iii)).\n",
              "In a section of the report headed NPPF (para 116) review, reference was made to that paragraph of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), which indicates that major development in an AONB should be permitted only in exceptional circumstances and where a public interest can be demonstrated.\n",
              "The officers regarded the level of harm to the AONB as significant, particularly to the south west of sector FL B where built development on the elevated and exposed terrain would seriously compromise the landscape character.\n",
              "They concluded: 2.447 Nevertheless it is your officers opinion that offsetting the landscape harm by the modifications outlined in this report would shift the planning balance in favour of the economic and other national benefits of the application.\n",
              "The local economic issues and specific circumstances of this case are considered to provide a finely balanced exceptional justification for this major AONB development, the benefits of which would be in the public interest.\n",
              "Essential to this conclusion would be seeking all the recommended conditions (changes) and ensuring (by condition / section 106 agreement) the deliverability of all the relevant application benefits.\n",
              "The rationale for the application is as a composite package, and any permission should therefore be framed to ensure the emergence of the proposals in a structured and comprehensive fashion.\n",
              "It was noted that the applicant had not yet been given an opportunity to comment on these proposed changes.\n",
              "If they were supported in principle by the Committee, it was suggested that they might delegate to officers to discuss with the applicant any minor variation of the proposed residential quantum, and the precise boundaries of the safeguarded area, although it was not envisaged that this should lead to any notable change in the recommended approach (para 2.448).\n",
              "On balance their conclusion in this case was that the application would, as a single comprehensive scheme, support rather than work against the overall objectives of sustainable development as defined by the NPPF (para 2.454).\n",
              "In a section headed Conclusion it was stated: the officer position is that the conditions / changes as set out in this report (informed by independent legal and financial viability advice) are well founded and that all are necessary to deliver the right composite package, including the economic benefits, so that an on balance recommendation of approval can reasonably be made. (para 2.457) The report ended with a recommendation for the grant of conditional planning permission (part outline, part full) for the various elements of the proposal, but with a limit of 365 residential units at Farthingloe, and subject to the completion of a planning agreement (under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990) to secure the proposed benefits including the hotel and conference centre.\n",

              "The result is to turn a positive land value of 5.85m to a negative land value of 3.03m.\n",
              "On the basis of this result, the scheme would not secure funding and could not proceed.\n",
              "For the avoidance of doubt, we do not agree with the planning officers assessment that the benefits provided by the Application scheme could also be provided by the sensitivity analysis mooted by Smiths Gore.\n",
              "Indeed, our view is that such a scheme would not be capable of providing the benefits offered and could not proceed as it would be incapable of providing a competitive return to the landowner and developers, as required by the National Planning Policy Framework.\n",
              "They also disagreed with the suggestion that the proposed changes would make the scheme more marketable.\n",

(Also on the agenda was one other minor planning application which was dealt with first.) On the Farthingloe application there were contributions by four members of the public (two for and two against).\n",
              "There was a detailed presentation by the officers of the proposals and the issues, during which reference was made to the issue of viability and the BNP Paribas letter, the effect of which was summarised.\n",
              "The minute continued: The Principal Planner advised the Committee that, having considered the further views of BNP Paribas, Smiths Gore stood by their analysis that a lower density scheme would be viable and would deliver the same monetary benefits as currently on offer.\n",
              "Officers therefore recommended that a lower density scheme should be approved as it was viable, not excessive for the site and would be compliant with the Core Strategy.\n",
              "After the officers presentation, five members were recorded as speaking in favour of the proposal, and one against.\n",
              "Another expressed concern about the security of the proposed payment of 5m.\n",
              "The views of three named supporters were expressed collectively; they saw it as a rare opportunity for regeneration and investment, and a courageous step necessary to give Dovers young people a future; of the proposed amendments they said: , it was felt that the application should not be restricted in the way proposed in the recommendation as this could jeopardise the viability of the scheme, deter other developers and be less effective in delivering the economic benefits.\n",
              "The Committee had to assess whether the advantages outweighed the harm that would be caused to the AONB.\n",
              "When seen from the ground and with effective screening, it was believed that this could be minimised.\n",
              "In these exceptional circumstances it was considered that the advantages did outweigh the harmful impact on the AONB.\n",
              "At the end of the discussion a motion was proposed that the officers recommendation be approved but subject to amendment of the number of houses from 365 to 521 as proposed in the application.\n",
              "The motion was carried (the voting is not recorded).\n",
              "The meeting was adjourned for 25 minutes to enable the officers to re word their recommendation with consequential amendments.\n",
              "A vote was then taken on the amended recommendation, which was approved.\n",

              "The introduction to the report made clear that its purpose was, not to revisit the decision to grant permission in the previous year, but to update the committee on the section 106 agreement, and to provide an assessment of planning considerations which have emerged since the resolution to grant planning permission (para 3).\n",
              "The report on the section 106 agreement confirmed that, contrary to the officers recommendation in June 2013, there was no obligation linking the provision of the hotel to the phasing of the residential development: The section 106 is drafted in accordance with the Committee resolution which places no obligation on the applicant to provide the hotel at any point in time and there is no obligation to provide the hotel at any stage during the build out of other development proposed in the application.\n",

              "Although he noted the relative thinness of the material available to the committee on the viability issue, he relied principally on the failure of the committee to assess and explain the degree of harm to the AONB, having regard to the strictness of the policy and the strong view of harm taken by the officers (paras 29 30).\n",
              "The only reference to this issue in the minutes spoke of the need to assess whether the advantages outweighed the harm to the AONB, wrongly implying that it was simply a question of striking a balance.\n",
              "Further the reference to minimising the harm by effective screening took no account of the officers view that the change of levels to the east would mean that over time, screening would be largely ineffective.\n",

              "The fact that, having participated, the public was not entitled to be told what the local planning authoritys reasons were, if planning permission was granted, was increasingly perceived as a justifiable source of grievance, which undermined confidence in the planning system Accordingly, between 2003 and 2013, local planning authorities were required to include in the notice of the decision a summary of their reasons for the grant of permission and a summary of the policies and proposals in the development plan which are relevant to the decision (see Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) (England) (Amendment) Order 2003 (SI 2003/2047) article 5; Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2010 (SI 2010/2184) article 31).\n",

              "The Explanatory Memorandum (paras 7.17 20) indicated that this was a response to suggestions that the duty had become burdensome and unnecessary, and having regard to the fact that officer reports typically provide far more detail on the logic and reasoning behind a particular decision than a decision notice, so that the requirement to provide a summary adds little to the transparency or the quality of the decision taking process; and also having regard to the greater level of transparency in the decision taking process, resulting from increased ease of access to information, both on line and through the Freedom of Information Act 2000.\n",
              "Officer decisions Since 2014 there has been a duty on a local authority officer making any decision involving the grant [of] a permission or licence to produce a written record of the decision along with the reasons for the decision, and details of alternative options, if any, considered and rejected (Openness of Local Government Bodies Regulations 2014 (SI 2014/2095) regulation 7(2) (3)).\n",

(regulation 24(1)(c)) This regulation is derived from article 9 of the EU Directive on environmental assessment (2011/92/EU) (the EA Directive), which expresses the duty in similar terms.\n",

              "They must enable the reader to understand why the matter was decided as it was and what conclusions were reached on the principal important controversial issues, disclosing how any issue of law or fact was resolved.\n",
              "Reasons can be briefly stated, the degree of particularity required depending entirely on the nature of the issues falling for decision.\n",
              "The reasoning must not give rise to a substantial doubt as to whether the decision maker erred in law, for example by misunderstanding some relevant policy or some other important matter or by failing to reach a rational decision on relevant grounds.\n",
              "But such adverse inference will not readily be drawn.\n",
              "The reasons need refer only to the main issues in the dispute, not to every material consideration.\n",
              "They should enable disappointed developers to assess their prospects of obtaining some alternative development permission, or, as the case may be, their unsuccessful opponents to understand how the policy or approach underlying the grant of permission may impact upon future such applications.\n",
              "Decision letters must be read in a straightforward manner, recognising that they are addressed to parties well aware of the issues involved and the arguments advanced.\n",
              "A reasons challenge will only succeed if the party aggrieved can satisfy the court that he has genuinely been substantially prejudiced by the failure to provide an adequately reasoned decision.\n",
              "In the course of his review of the authorities he had referred with approval to the felicitous observation of Sir Thomas Bingham MR in Clarke Homes Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment (1993) 66 P & CR 263, 271 272, identifying the central issue in the case as: whether the decision of the Secretary of State leaves room for genuine as opposed to forensic doubt as to what he has decided and why.\n",
              "This is an issue to be resolved as the parties agree on a straightforward down to earth reading of his decision letter without excessive legalism or exegetical sophistication.\n",
              "There has been some debate about whether Lord Browns words are applicable to a decision by a local planning authority, rather than the Secretary of State or an inspector.\n",
              "It is true that the case concerned a statutory challenge to the decision of the Secretary of State on a planning appeal.\n",
              "However, the authorities reviewed by Lord Brown were not confined to such cases.\n",
              "They included, for example, the decision of the House of Lords upholding the short reasons given by Westminster City Council explaining the office policies in its development plan (Westminster City Council v Great Portland Estates plc [1985] AC 661, 671 673).\n",
              "Lord Scarman adopted the guidance of earlier cases at first instance, not limited to planning cases (eg In re Poyser and Mills Arbitration [1964] 2 QB 467, 478), that the reasons must be proper, adequate and intelligible and can be briefly stated (p 673E G).\n",
              "Similarly local planning authorities are able to give relatively short reasons for refusals of planning permission without any suggestion that they are inadequate.\n",
              "In the context of the EIA regulations, Mr Reed QC (for CGI) relied on the fact that under Regulation 24(1)(c)(ii) the duty is limited to the main reasons.\n",
              "He drew an analogy with the former duty of local planning authorities to provide summary reasons for the grant of permission, which was treated as imposing a less onerous standard than that considered in Porter.\n",
              "Thus in R (Siraj) v Kirklees Metropolitan Council [2010] EWCA Civ 1286, Sullivan LJ said summary reasons in that context could not be equated with reasons in a Secretary of States decision letter: a decision letter is intended to be a stand alone document which contains a full explanation of the Secretary of States reasons for allowing or dismissing an appeal.\n",
              "By their very nature a local planning authoritys summary reasons for granting planning permission do not present a full account of the local planning authoritys decision making process. (para 14)\n",
              "Mr Reed sought to apply this thinking to the duty to give the main reasons under the EIA regulations.\n",
              "He referred to R (Cherkley Campaign Ltd) v Mole Valley District Council [2014] EWCA Civ 567, para 70, where counsel was recorded as conceding (apparently without demur from the court) that the duty under the EIA was no higher than the duty to give summary reasons under domestic planning legislation.\n",
              "I am unable to accept the analogy.\n",
              "I do not read the reference in the EIA regulations to the main reasons as materially limiting the ordinary duty in such cases.\n",
              "It is no different in substance from Lord Browns reference in Porter to the need to refer only to the main issues in the dispute.\n",
              "To my mind the guidance in Porter is equally relevant in the EIA context.\n",
              "Lang J in R (Hawksworth Securities plc v Peterborough City Council [2016] EWHC 1870 (Admin) made a more general point about what she saw as the difference between a planning inspector conducting an adversarial procedure, akin to court or tribunal proceedings, contrasted with a local planning authority as an administrative body, determining an individual application: Its reasons ought to state why planning permission was granted, usually by reference to the relevant planning policies.\n",
              "But it is not conducting a formal adjudication in a dispute between the applicant for planning permission and objectors, and so it is not required to give reasons for rejecting the representations made by those who object to the grant of planning permission. (para 87)\n",
              "I am not persuaded that the difference between the two processes bears such significance.\n",
              "In both the decision maker may have to take into account and deal fairly with a wide range of differing views and interests, and reach a reasoned conclusion on them.\n",
              "Where there is a legal requirement to give reasons, what is needed is an adequate explanation of the ultimate decision.\n",
              "The content of that duty should not in principle turn on differences in the procedures by which it is arrived at.\n",
              "Local planning authorities are under an unqualified statutory duty to give reasons for refusing permission.\n",
              "There is no reason in principle why the duty to give reasons for grant of permission should become any more onerous.\n",
              "There is of course the important difference that, as Sullivan J pointed out in Siraj, the decision letter of the Secretary of State or a planning inspector is designed as a stand alone document setting out all the relevant background material and policies, before reaching a reasoned conclusion.\n",
              "In the case of a decision of the local planning authority that function will normally be performed by the planning officers report.\n",
              "If their recommendation is accepted by the members, no further reasons may be needed.\n",
              "Even if it is not accepted, it may normally be enough for the committees statement of reasons to be limited to the points of difference.\n",
              "However the essence of the duty remains the same, as does the issue for the court: that is, in the words of Sir Thomas Bingham MR, whether the information so provided by the authority leaves room for genuine doubt as to what (it) has decided and why.\n",
              "Legal remedies\n",
              "In the case of a decision by the Secretary of State or a planning inspector, the 1990 Act provides for a statutory challenge under section 288, on the grounds that the decision was not within the powers of the Act, or that a relevant requirement (which includes a requirement under the inquiries procedure rules to give notice of the decision and the reasons for it) had not been complied with.\n",
              "In the latter case the court must be satisfied also that the interests of the applicant have been substantially prejudiced by the failure (section 288(5)(b)).\n",
              "I note that in the Save case, Lord Bridge identified a single question: There are in truth not two separate questions: (1) were the reasons adequate? (2) if not, were the interests of the applicant substantially prejudiced thereby? The single indivisible question, in my opinion, which the court must ask itself whenever a planning decision is challenged on the ground of a failure to give reasons is whether the interests of the applicant have been substantially prejudiced by the deficiency of the reasons given. (p 167D E) I am not convinced with respect that it is helpful so to conflate the two parts of the statutory formula.\n",
              "Until one has decided on the nature of the breach of the statutory requirements, it is difficult to determine the nature and extent of any prejudice.\n",
              "However, that passage needs to be read in the context of what follows (p 168), which makes clear that Lord Bridges principal concern was to emphasise, contrary to the apparent implication of the judgment of Woolf LJ in the Court of Appeal, that the burden lay on the applicant to establish both parts of the statutory test.\n",
              "In Save itself, the decision of the House ultimately turned on the adequacy of the reasons for departing from the policy, rather than lack of prejudice.\n",
              "Lord Bridge accepted that an opponent of development, whether the local planning authority or some unofficial body like Save, may be substantially prejudiced by a decision to grant permission in which the planning considerations on which the decision is based, particularly if they relate to planning policy, are not explained sufficiently clearly to indicate what, if any, impact they may have in relation to the decision of future applications. (p 167H) The same point is picked up in Lord Browns summary.\n",
              "Lord Bridge did not, as I understand him, dissent from the view of the Court of Appeal that, had Save been able to establish a material defect of reasoning, the appropriate remedy was to quash the permission.\n",
              "Mr Cameron QC (for the Council) argued that a different approach should apply to a breach of the EIA duty taken on its own.\n",
              "Relying on the decision of the Court of Appeal in R (Richardson) v North Yorkshire County Council [2004] 1 WLR 1920, he argued that in that context a mere declaration of the breach was sufficient.\n",
              "Indeed before Mitting J (para 22) this point was conceded by Mr Westaway for CPRE Kent.\n",
              "Although the point was raised in argument in the Court of Appeal, Laws LJ apparently found it unnecessary to address the issue, perhaps because he saw the EIA duty, not as a free standing duty, but as no more than one of the factors relevant to the obligation to give reasons in this case.\n",
              "In Richardson, notwithstanding a clear failure to provide a statement of reasons as required by regulation 21 of the EIA regulations then in force (Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England & Wales) Regulations 1999), the Court of Appeal held that the appropriate remedy was, not to quash the decision itself, but to make a mandatory order for the required statement to be provided.\n",
              "In the leading judgment, Simon Brown LJ (para 33) adopted the reasoning of Richards J (at first instance), who had said: 49. the first and most important point in the present case is that regulation 21(1) looks to the position after the grant of planning permission.\n",
              "It is concerned with making information available to the public as to what has been decided and why it has been decided, rather than laying down requirements for the decision making process itself.\n",
              "It implements the obligation in article 9(1) of the directive to make information available to the public when a decision to grant development consent has been taken (emphasis added).\n",
              "That is to be contrasted with article 2(1) of the Directive, which lays down requirements as to what must be done before the grant of planning permission (which may be granted only after a prior assessment of significant environmental effects). 50.\n",
              "The fact that the requirement focuses on the availability of information for public inspection after the decision has been made, rather than on the decision making process, leads me to the view that a breach of regulation 21(1) ought not to lead necessarily to the quashing of the decision itself.\n",
              "A breach should be capable in principle of being remedied, and the legislative purpose achieved, by a mandatory order requiring the authority to make available a statement at the place, and containing the information, specified in the regulation.\n",
              "With respect to the judges concerned, I would decline to follow that reasoning.\n",
              "I find the distinction drawn between notification of the decision, and of the reasons on which it is based, artificial and unconvincing.\n",
              "In the regulations (as in the Aarhus Convention, which is now expressly referred to in the Directive) the provision of reasons is an intrinsic part of the procedure, essential to ensure effective public participation.\n",
              "I would not necessarily disagree with the courts disposal of the appeal in Richardson.\n",
              "Although the committee had not given its own reasons, it had granted permission in accordance with the recommendation in the officers report, and could be taken to have adopted its reasoning.\n",
              "Simon Brown LJ (para 35) referred with approval to the comment of Sullivan J (R v Mendip District Council, Ex p Fabre (2000) 80 P & CR 500, 511) that in such a case the reasonable inference is that the members did so for the reasons advanced by the officer, unless of course there is some indication to the contrary.\n",
              "It is perhaps also relevant that the court was faced with a somewhat extreme submission (based on observations of Lord Hoffmann in Berkeley v Secretary of State for the Environment [2001] 2 AC 603, 616 617), that in respect of a breach of an EU directive the court had no choice in the matter; it was simply not permitted to regard a breach of the implementing regulations as curable other than by the outright quashing of the development permission granted. (para 38) Not surprisingly the court found that an unattractive proposition.\n",
              "However, it is now clear, following recent judgments of this court, that even in respect of a breach of an EU directive the powers of the court are not so restricted: the court retains a discretion to refuse relief if the applicant has been able in practice to enjoy the rights conferred by European legislation, and there has been no substantial prejudice (per Lord Carnwath, (R (Champion) v North Norfolk District Council & Anor [2015] UKSC 52; [2015] 1 WLR 3710, para 54, following Walton v Scottish Ministers [2012] UKSC 44; [2013] PTSR 51, paras 139, 155).\n",
              "In Champion itself it was held that this test was met: given that the environmental issues were of no particular complexity or novelty; there was only one issue of substance on which each of the statutory agencies had satisfied itself of the effectiveness of the proposed measures; the public had been fully involved; and Mr Champion himself having been given the opportunity to raise any specific points of concern but having been unable to do so (para 60).\n",
              "Duty to give reasons Common law\n",
              "Given the existence of a specific duty under the EIA regulations, and the views I have expressed on its effect, it is strictly unnecessary in the present appeal to decide what common law duty there may be on a local planning authority to give reasons for grant of a planning permission.\n",
              "However, since it has been a matter of some controversy in planning circles, and since we have heard full argument, it is right that we should consider it.\n",
              "Public authorities are under no general common law duty to give reasons for their decisions; but it is well established that fairness may in some circumstances require it, even in a statutory context in which no express duty is imposed (see R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Doody [1994] 1 AC 531; R v Higher Education Funding Council, Ex p Institute of Dental Surgery [1994] 1 WLR 242, 263A D; De Smiths Judicial Review 7th ed, para 7 099).\n",
              "Doody concerned the power of the Home Secretary (under the Criminal Justice Act 1967 section 61(1)), in relation to a prisoner under a mandatory life sentence for murder, to fix the minimum period before consideration by the Parole Board for licence, taking account of the penal element as recommended by the trial judge.\n",
              "It was held that such a decision was subject to judicial review, and that the prisoner was entitled to be informed of the judges recommendation and of the reasons for the Home Secretarys decision: To mount an effective attack on the decision, given no more material than the facts of the offence and the length of the penal element, the prisoner has virtually no means of ascertaining whether this is an instance where the decision making process has gone astray.\n",
              "I think it important that there should be an effective means of detecting the kind of error which would entitle the court to intervene, and in practice I regard it as necessary for this purpose that the reasoning of the Home Secretary should be disclosed.\n",
              "If there is any difference between the penal element recommended by the judges and actually imposed by the Home Secretary, this reasoning is bound to include, either explicitly or implicitly, a reason why the Home Secretary has taken a different view (p 565G H per Lord Mustill) It is to be noted that a principal justification for imposing the duty was seen as the need to reveal any such error as would entitle the court to intervene, and so make effective the right to challenge the decision by judicial review.\n",
              "Similarly, in the planning context, the Court of Appeal has held that a local planning authority generally is under no common law duty to give reasons for the grant of planning permission (R v Aylesbury Vale District Council, Ex p Chaplin (1998) 76 P & CR 207, 211 212 per Pill LJ).\n",
              "Although this general principle was reaffirmed recently in Oakley v South Cambridgeshire District Council [2017] 2 P & CR 4, the court held that a duty did arise in the particular circumstances of that case: where the development would have a significant and lasting impact on the local community, and involved a substantial departure from Green Belt and development plan policies, and where the committee had disagreed with its officers recommendations.\n",
              "Of the last point, Elias LJ (giving the leading judgment, with which Patten LJ agreed) said: The significance of that fact is not simply that it will often leave the reasoning obscure.\n",
              "In addition, the fact that the committee is disagreeing with a careful and clear recommendation from a highly experienced officer on a matter of such potential significance to very many people suggests that some explanation is required the dictates of good administration and the need for transparency are particularly strong here, and they reinforce the justification for imposing the common law duty. (para 61) His conclusion was reinforced by reference to the United Kingdoms obligations under the Aarhus Convention (para 62; see to similar effect my own comments on the relevance of the Convention, in Walton v Scottish Ministers [2012] UKSC 44; [2013] PTSR 51, para 100).\n",
              "Sales LJ agreed with the result, but expressed concern that the imposition of such duties might deter otherwise public spirited volunteers from council duties, and might also introduce an unwelcome element of delay into the planning system (para 76).\n",
              "Mr Cameron QC (for the Council) submitted that this decision should be treated with care, against the background of the governments decision in 2013 to abrogate the statutory duty to give reasons for grant of permission, planning law being a creature of statute (see Hopkins Homes Ltd v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2017] 1 WLR 1865, para 20).\n",
              "The factors identified by Elias LJ could arise in many cases, and lead to the common law duty becoming a general rule.\n",
              "He asked us to prefer the view of Lang J (R (Hawksworth Securities plc) v Peterborough City Council [2016] EWHC 1870 (Admin), para 81) that a common law duty to give reasons would arise only exceptionally and that generally, the requirements of fairness will be met by public access to the material available to the decision maker.\n",
              "The present case, he submitted, was not exceptional in that sense, either in principle or on its own facts.\n",
              "In my view Oakley was rightly decided, and consistent with the general law as established by the House of Lords in Doody.\n",
              "Although planning law is a creature of statute, the proper interpretation of the statute is underpinned by general principles, properly referred to as derived from the common law.\n",
              "Doody itself involved such an application of the common law principle of fairness in a statutory context, in which the giving of reasons was seen as essential to allow effective supervision by the courts.\n",
              "Fairness provided the link between the common law duty to give reasons for an administrative decision, and the right of the individual affected to bring proceedings to challenge the legality of that decision.\n",
              "Doody concerned fairness as between the state and an individual citizen.\n",
              "The same principle is relevant also to planning decisions, the legality of which may be of legitimate interest to a much wider range of parties, private and public (see Walton v Scottish Ministers [2012] UKSC 44; [2013] PTSR 51, paras 152 153 per Lord Hope).\n",
              "Here a further common law principle is in play.\n",
              "Lord Bridge saw the statutory duty to give reasons as the analogue of the common law principle that justice should not only be done, but also be seen to be done (see para 25 above).\n",
              "That principle of open justice or transparency extends as much to statutory inquiries and procedures as it does to the courts (see Kennedy v The Charity Commission [2014] UKSC 20; [2015] AC 455, para 47 per Lord Mance, para 127 per Lord Toulson).\n",
              "As applied to the environment it also underpins the Aarhus Convention, and the relevant parts of the EA Directive.\n",
              "In this respect the common law, and European law and practice, march together (compare Kennedy para 46 per Lord Mance).\n",
              "In the application of the principle to planning decisions, I see no reason to distinguish between a Ministerial inquiry, and the less formal, but equally public, decision making process of a local planning authority such as in this case.\n",
              "The existence of a common law duty to disclose the reasons for a decision, supplementing the statutory rules, is not inconsistent with the abrogation in 2013 of the specific duty imposed by the former rules to give reasons for the grant of permission.\n",
              "As the explanatory memorandum made clear, that was not intended to detract from the general principle of transparency (which was affirmed), but was a practical acknowledgement of the different ways in which that objective could normally be attained without adding unnecessarily to the administrative burden.\n",
              "In circumstances where the objective is not achieved by other means, there should be no objection to the common law filling the gap.\n",
              "Thus in Oakley the Court of Appeal were entitled in my view to hold that, in the special circumstances of that case, openness and fairness to objectors required the members reasons to be stated.\n",
              "Such circumstances were found in the widespread public controversy surrounding the proposal, and the departure from development plan and Green Belt policies; combined with the members disagreement with the officers recommendation, which made it impossible to infer the reasons from their report or other material available to the public.\n",
              "The same combination is found in the present case, and, in my view, would if necessary have justified the imposition of a common law duty to provide reasons for the decision.\n",
              "This endorsement of the Court of Appeals approach may be open to the criticism that it leaves some uncertainty about what particular factors are sufficient to trigger the common law duty, and indeed as to the justification for limiting the duty at all (see the perceptive analysis by Dr Joanna Bell: Kent and Oakley: A Re examination of the Common Law Duty to Give Reasons for Grants of Planning Permission and Beyond (2017) 22 Judicial Review 105 113).\n",
              "The answer to the latter must lie in the relationship of the common law and the statutory framework.\n",
              "The court should respect the exercise of Ministerial discretion, in designating certain categories of decision for a formal statement of reasons.\n",
              "But it may also take account of the fact that the present system of rules has developed piecemeal and without any apparent pretence of overall coherence.\n",
              "It is appropriate for the common law to fill the gaps, but to limit that intervention to circumstances where the legal policy reasons are particularly strong.\n",
              "As to the charge of uncertainty, it would be wrong to be over prescriptive, in a judgment on a single case and a single set of policies.\n",
              "However it should not be difficult for councils and their officers to identify cases which call for a formulated statement of reasons, beyond the statutory requirements.\n",
              "Typically they will be cases where, as in Oakley and the present case, permission has been granted in the face of substantial public opposition and against the advice of officers, for projects which involve major departures from the development plan, or from other policies of recognised importance (such as the specific policies identified in the NPPF para 22 above).\n",
              "Such decisions call for public explanation, not just because of their immediate impact; but also because, as Lord Bridge pointed out (para 45 above), they are likely to have lasting relevance for the application of policy in future cases.\n",
              "Finally, with regard to Sales LJs concerns about the burden on members, it is important to recognise that the debate is not about the necessity for a planning authority to make its decision on rational grounds, but about when it is required to disclose the reasons for those decisions, going beyond the documentation that already exists as part of the decision making process.\n",
              "Members are of course entitled to depart from their officers recommendation for good reasons, but their reasons for doing so need to be capable of articulation, and open to public scrutiny.\n",
              "There is nothing novel or unduly burdensome about this.\n",
              "The Lawyers in Local Government Model Council Planning Code and Protocol (2013 update) gives the following useful advice, under the heading Decision making: Do make sure that if you are proposing, seconding or supporting a decision contrary to officer recommendations or the development plan that you clearly identify and understand the planning reasons leading to this conclusion / decision.\n",
              "These reasons must be given prior to the vote and be recorded.\n",
              "Be aware that you may have to justify the resulting decision by giving evidence in the event of any challenge. (their emphasis)\n",
              "The decision in this case\n",
              "The members of the Dover planning committee on 13 June 2013 had an unenviable task.\n",
              "The meeting started at six in the evening, probably for most of them at the end of a hard working day.\n",
              "They were faced with probably the most significant planning application for their area for many years.\n",
              "It was no doubt seen as the culmination of an extended process of formal and informal consultation, triggered by the submission of the application over a year before, and they may have felt under some pressure to reach a conclusion.\n",
              "The officers report, admirable though it was, had arrived on their desks only a few days before the meeting.\n",
              "Not only was it long and detailed in itself, but it introduced into the debate a new element of potentially critical significance (the proposed reduction in the number of houses), on which there was a sharp difference of view between the expert advisers.\n",
              "The Model Council Planning Code and Protocol, already referred to (para 60 above) contains under the same heading the following advice: Do come to your decision only after due consideration of all of the information reasonably required upon which to base a decision.\n",
              "If you feel there is insufficient time to digest new information or that there is simply insufficient information before you, request that further information.\n",
              "If necessary, defer or refuse.\n",
              "This passage not only offers sound practical advice.\n",
              "It also reflects the important legal principle that a decision maker must not only ask himself the right question, but take reasonable steps to acquaint himself with the relevant information to enable him to answer it correctly (Secretary of State for Education and Science v Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council [1977] AC 1014, 1065B).\n",
              "That obligation, which applies to a planning committee as much as to the Secretary of State, includes the need to allow the time reasonably necessary, not only to obtain the relevant information, but also to understand and take it properly into account.\n",
              "Even if there was pressure for a decision on the principle of the development, it seems unfortunate that the members did not apparently consider deferring detailed discussion of the officers proposed modifications, including the contentious issue of viability.\n",
              "It is difficult to see how the members could have expected to reach a properly considered decision on the material then before them.\n",
              "With hindsight at least, given that the application did not come back to the committee for more than a year, nothing would have been lost.\n",
              "The issue of timing is not directly relevant to the reasons challenge before us, but it is an important part of the background.\n",
              "It is not in dispute that the Council was in breach of a specific requirement under the EIA regulations to make available a statement of the main reasons and considerations on which the decision was based.\n",
              "The only issue is the nature of the remedy.\n",
              "Mr Cameron submits that a declaration is sufficient and that the reasons can be supplied retrospectively.\n",
              "In so far as this submission is specific to the EIA duty, following the decision of the Court of Appeal in Richardson, I cannot accept it for the reasons already given.\n",
              "The report of Oakley does not indicate what order resulted in that case.\n",
              "In the present case, however, I am satisfied that that is not an appropriate or sufficient remedy.\n",
              "Indeed it is notable that in the three years since the permission was issued, no attempt has been made to formulate the reasons so as to make good the admitted breach.\n",
              "This perhaps underlines the difficulty of reconstructing the operative reasons of the committee on the basis simply of what is in the minutes.\n",
              "Mr Cameron relies on the views attributed to the three members who were recorded as supporting the proposal.\n",
              "That was against the background that the officers had recommended approval for a departure from the AONB policies, for reasons they had explained, and which the committee can be taken to have accepted.\n",
              "The only substantial difference was as to whether a reduced dwelling limit should be imposed.\n",
              "That was seen by the committee as turning on whether the risk to the viability of the scheme outweighed the harm to the AONB.\n",
              "That issue, he submits, was fully debated and the majoritys conclusion and reasoning were clearly reflected in the minutes.\n",
              "The restrictions proposed by the officers were not accepted because (in the words there recorded) this could jeopardise the viability of the scheme, deter other developments and be less effective in delivering the economic benefits.\n",
              "This submission rests on the uncertain assumption that the views of the three members quoted were shared by the majority.\n",
              "The required statement under the regulations is of the reasoning of the committee as a whole.\n",
              "Even making that assumption, there are serious gaps.\n",
              "There is no indication of how or why the members felt able, without further investigation, to reject the view of their own advisers that the viability of the scheme need not be threatened, and indeed could be enhanced.\n",
              "It was not enough to rely on the possibility of the scheme being jeopardised, simply on the say so of the applicants advisers without any reference to the expert view to the contrary.\n",
              "Another important issue was the officers insistence on the need for implementation as a single comprehensive scheme to secure the economic benefits, including in particular the hotel and conference centre, and for conditions or planning obligations to achieve that.\n",
              "Given that the members apparently shared their officers view of the importance of those benefits, their omission of any legal mechanism to secure it needed explanation.\n",
              "Furthermore, as Laws LJ pointed out, the economic argument was only one side of the picture.\n",
              "The other was the members view of the harm to the AONB.\n",
              "Assuming that they accepted their officers view as to the seriousness of the potential damage to the AONB, it became critical to understand the basis of their belief that it could be minimised by effective screening.\n",
              "This was of particular significance in the context of the EIA regulations which require the statement to include a description of the main measures to avoid, reduce and, if possible, offset the major adverse effects of the development.\n",
              "If the committee had reason to think that landscaping measures could reduce or offset the harm, they needed to be described.\n",
              "At the very least there needed to be an explanation of how the members reconciled this assertion with the view of their officers that landscaping would be largely ineffective.\n",
              "This point was left without any explanation.\n",
              "These points were not merely incidental, but were fundamental to the officers support for the amended scheme.\n",
              "The committees failure to address such points raises a substantial doubt (in Lord Browns words) as to whether they had properly understood the key issues or reached a rational conclusion on them on relevant grounds.\n",
              "This is a case where the defect in reasons goes to the heart of the justification for the permission, and undermines its validity.\n",

              "No such placement had yet been identified, and so it was not possible for the FtT to discharge him then.\n",
              "But the FtT was invited to rule upon whether, as a matter of principle, it would be lawful to discharge him on condition that he complied with a care plan which would amount to a deprivation of liberty.\n",
              "The FtT ruled that it had no such power.\n",
              "In doing so, it followed the decision of the Court of Appeal in B v Secretary of State for Justice [2011] EWCA Civ 1608; [2012] 1 WLR 2043 that the FtT had no power to impose conditions which in themselves amounted to a deprivation of liberty.\n",
              "It rejected an argument that this could be circumvented by a condition of compliance with a care plan, because the conditions in the care plan would be imposed by the authority which devised and implemented the care plan, and not by the hospital or the FtT. It also found that any consent which the patient purported to give would not be a genuine, properly considered and reliable consent, given his propensity to change his mind and that the only alternative was to remain in hospital.\n",
              "It made no decision as to whether such a discharge would be appropriate in his case.\n",
              "On the patients appeal to the Upper Tribunal, Charles J decided that there was power to impose a condition of compliance with a care package, provided that the patient had the capacity to consent to it and did consent: [2015] UKUT 644 (AAC); [2016] MHLR 198.\n",
              "On the Secretary of States appeal to the Court of Appeal, the court held that it was bound by the ratio of B, which was clear: there was no power to impose conditions which amounted to a deprivation of liberty, even with the consent of a patient with the capacity to do so, and the appeal was allowed: [2017] EWCA Civ 194; [2017] 1 WLR 4681.\n",
              "The patient now appeals to this court.\n",
              "The legal background\n",
              "Restriction orders have their origin in the Mental Health Act 1959, which is the foundation of the modern mental health law, now contained in the 1983 Act (as later amended, principally by the Mental Health Act 2007).\n",
              "Under an ordinary hospital order, the patient was admitted to hospital for treatment for a defined period, which could be renewed from time to time by his responsible medical officer (now his responsible clinician).\n",
              "He could be discharged by his responsible medical officer, the hospital managers or a Mental Health Review Tribunal (now the FtT).\n",
              "In other words, the length of time he spent in hospital was in the hands of the medical authorities or the tribunal.\n",
              "There was no power to recall him to hospital after discharge, although he could be admitted afresh if the grounds existed.\n",
              "Under what is now called a restriction order, on the other hand, the patients detention lasted indefinitely, and the powers of the responsible medical officer to discharge him or even to grant him leave of absence, could only be exercised with the consent of the Home Secretary (now the Secretary of State for Justice).\n",
              "The Home Secretary had an independent power to grant a discharge, which could be either absolute or conditional; if conditional, the patient could be recalled to hospital at any time.\n",
              "Those powers survive unchanged into what is now section 42(2) and (3) of the MHA 1983.\n",
              "It is not express, but must be implicit, that the Secretary of State has power to vary the conditions from time to time.\n",
              "Other than that, neither the 1959 Act or its successor the 1983 Act said anything about the kinds of condition which might be imposed and they provided no sanctions for their breach, other than the possibility of recall to hospital.\n",
              "Under the 1959 Act, the Mental Health Review Tribunal could review the case periodically, but could only make recommendations to the Home Secretary and had no power itself to grant a discharge.\n",
              "Thus, from the states point of view, a restriction order combined the advantages of a hospital order with the advantages of indefinite preventive detention and a power of instant recall to hospital after a conditional discharge.\n",
              "All of this was enacted before the United Kingdom recognised the right of individual petition to the European Court of Human Rights in 1966.\n",
              "In X v United Kingdom (1981) 4 EHRR 181, a conditionally discharged restricted patient complained that he had been recalled to hospital after three years in the community, without any grounds having to be shown and without immediate recourse to a tribunal which could direct his release.\n",
              "The court held that, under article 5(1)(e) of the ECHR, he could only be detained as a person of unsound mind if the criteria laid down in Winterwerp v The Netherlands (1979) 2 EHRR 387 were fulfilled: he must reliably be shown to be suffering from a true mental disorder, established on the basis of objective medical expertise; the disorder must be of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement; and the validity of continued confinement would depend upon the persistence of such a disorder.\n",
              "In Xs case, the court saw no reason to doubt the medical opinion that these criteria did exist when he was recalled to hospital.\n",
              "On the other hand, the court did find a breach of article 5(4), which requires that every person deprived of his liberty by detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\n",
              "The result of this (and other developments) was that the 1959 Act was amended in 1982 and then consolidated in the MHA 1983.\n",
              "Restricted patients detained in hospital were given the right to apply to a Mental Health Review Tribunal within the same periods that ordinary hospital order patients could apply: that is, once within the second six months after detention and once within every 12 months thereafter (section 70).\n",
              "A conditionally discharged patient could apply once within the second 12 months after his discharge and within every two-year period thereafter (section 75(2)).\n",
              "If a conditionally discharged patient is recalled to hospital, his case must be referred to a tribunal within one month of the recall (section 75(1)(a)).\n",
              "He himself can also apply within the same periods after his recall as he could after his initial detention (section 75(1)(b)).\n",
              "Allied to that, the tribunal was itself given the power to discharge a restricted patient, either absolutely or conditionally.\n",
              "Originally, the tribunal had to be satisfied that the grounds for detention did not exist; but this was amended, following a declaration of incompatibility, by the Mental Health Act 1983 (Remedial) Order 2001 (SI 2001/3712).\n",
              "As the MHA now stands, the patient must be discharged if the tribunal is not satisfied that all the grounds for his detention continue to exist: ie that he is suffering from mental disorder or from mental disorder of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be liable to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment; or that it is necessary for the health or safety of the patient or for the protection of other persons that he should continue to receive such treatment; or that appropriate medical treatment is available for him (section 72(1)(b)(i), (ii) and (iia)).\n",
              "If the tribunal is (a) not so satisfied and (b) is satisfied that it is not appropriate for the patient to remain liable to be recalled to hospital for medical treatment, it must direct his absolute discharge (section 73(1)).\n",
              "Where (a) applies but (b) does not, the tribunal must direct his conditional discharge (section 73(2)).\n",
              "Where a tribunal directs a conditional discharge, the Secretary of State may recall the patient to hospital at any time under section 42(3) (section 73(4)(a)).\n",
              "The patient must also comply with the conditions imposed by the tribunal at the time or by the Secretary of State at any later time (section 73(4)(b)).\n",
              "The Secretary of State may vary the conditions set either by the tribunal or by himself at any time (section 73(5)).\n",
              "Thus the Secretary of State is in complete charge of what the conditions are and whether the patient should be recalled to hospital.\n",
              "There are no sanctions for breach of the conditions other than recall to hospital, which may be at any time.\n",
              "No criteria for recall are laid down in the MHA.\n",
              "However, the logic of X v United Kingdom is that at least the Winterwerp criteria must be satisfied; and in any event, the tribunal will have to discharge the patient once more if not satisfied that the MHA criteria are met (and see R (MM) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] EWCA Civ 687, (2007) 98 BMLR 130, where it was agreed that breach of a condition was not a free-standing ground for recall and the Secretary of State must form a view of whether the statutory criteria are met).\n",
              "However, the MHA says nothing, and has never said anything, about what the conditions may be.\n",
              "In practice, the Secretary of State will usually impose conditions of residence at a stated address and for both clinical and social supervision.\n",
              "The social supervisor provides practical support, for example in accessing the aftercare services to which the patient is entitled under section 117 of the MHA, and is expected to have regular meetings with the patient (Ministry of Justice, Guidance for social supervisors, 18 March 2009).\n",
              "The clinical supervisor is responsible for the regular assessment of the patients mental health and monitoring his medication (Ministry of Justice, Guidance for clinical supervisors, 18 March 2009).\n",
              "The Ministry expects reports from both supervisors after the first month and every three months thereafter.\n",
              "It is usually a condition that the patient shall comply with treatment as directed by the clinical supervisor (para 23 of the Guidance for clinical supervisors).\n",
              "However, the power to impose treatment without consent upon hospital patients, by force if need be, contained in section 63 of the MHA, does not apply to conditionally discharged restricted patients (section 56(3)(c), as substituted by section 34(2) of the 2007 Act).\n",
              "A patient is entitled to refuse treatment unless he lacks the capacity to make the decision, in which case the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) may permit treatment which is in his best interests, but will only permit coercion in order to impose treatment in very limited circumstances (MCA, sections 5 and 6).\n",
              "Hence, in R (SH) v Mental Health Review Tribunal [2007] EWHC 884 (Admin); (2007) 10 CCLR 306, Holman J rejected a challenge to the legality of a condition to comply with treatment as being contrary both to the common law right to choose what medical treatment to have and to the right to respect for private life in article 8 of the ECHR.\n",
              "Although the condition said shall comply, the patient remained free to choose whether or not to have the treatment at each and every time when he was required to do so.\n",
              "That refusal would not, by itself, necessarily lead to his recall to hospital.\n",
              "Nevertheless, the Secretary of States policy on recall states that failure to comply with medication will usually trigger consideration of whether the patient should be recalled, as would non-compliance with other conditions.\n",
              "Whether the patient is in fact recalled depends on a range of factors (Ministry of Justice, The recall of conditionally discharged restricted patients, 4 February 2009, paras 5 and 7).\n",
              "The arguments\n",
              "The purpose of conditional discharge is to enable the patient to make a safe transition from the more institutional setting of a hospital to a less institutional setting in the community.\n",
              "Transition through progressively less secure hospital conditions before discharge into the community is common and conditional discharge is part of the same continuum.\n",
              "As Lord Bingham put it in R (H) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] UKHL 59; [2004] 2 AC 253, at para 26: the conditional discharge regime, properly used, is of great benefit to patients and the public and conducive to the Convention object of restricting the curtailment of personal liberty.\n",
              "If there is any possibility of treating and supervising a patient in the community, the imposition of conditions permits that possibility to be explored and, it may be, tried.\n",
              "So why, in an appropriate case, asks Mr David Lock QC on behalf of the patient, should that purpose not be served by a transition into a community setting which is different from a hospital but nevertheless amounts to a deprivation of liberty, because the patient is under continuous supervision and control and not free to leave? If this condition cannot be imposed, the patient will stay in hospital longer than he otherwise would have done and the MHAs rehabilitative purpose will be frustrated.\n",
              "He argues that there is nothing in either the common law interpretation of section 73(2) (or for that matter section 42(2)) or in article 5 of the ECHR to prevent the imposition of such a condition where the patient consents to it and has the capacity so to do.\n",
              "As to the common law, the interpretation of section 73(2) (and section 42(2)) may depend, in part at least, on what is meant by discharge.\n",
              "Does it mean, as the patient argues, discharge from detention in the hospital where he is currently detained or, as the Secretary of State argues, discharge from the liability to be detained? If it means the latter, then a condition of continued detention, albeit not in a hospital, would not amount to a discharge.\n",
              "If it means the former, then that obstacle at least is removed.\n",
              "In Secretary of State for the Home Department v Mental Health Review Tribunal for Mersey Regional Health Authority [1986] 1 WLR 1170, Mann J held that it meant discharge from hospital, so that a condition could not be imposed that the patient reside in another hospital, even if not under conditions of detention.\n",
              "In R (Secretary of State for the Home Department) v Mental Health Review Tribunal, PH as interested party [2002] EWHC 1128 (Admin); [2002] MHLR 241, known as PH, Elias J held that it meant discharge from detention in hospital, so that there could be a discharge on condition of residence in another hospital: but he also held that the crucial question was whether the conditions amounted to detention, which was not permitted.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal proceeded on the assumption that this proposition was correct and decided that the conditions imposed were not such as to amount to a deprivation of liberty and therefore that they were not ultra vires: [2002] EWCA Civ 1868; [2003] MHLR 202.\n",
              "The MHA draws a clear distinction between being actually detained, being liable to be detained, and being neither.\n",
              "A patient who is detained in hospital under compulsory powers such as a hospital order, including a restriction order, is actually detained.\n",
              "A hospital order or other compulsorily detained patient who is granted leave of absence under section 17 of the MHA remains liable to be detained (see section 17(1)).\n",
              "A patient who is released from hospital under a community treatment order under section 17A is not liable to be detained (see section 17D(2), as inserted by section 32(2) of the 2007 Act).\n",
              "But a restricted patient who is granted a conditional discharge remains liable to be detained: this much appears from section 42(2), which states that a restricted patient who is absolutely discharged ceases to be liable to be detained, with the clear implication that a restricted patient who is conditionally discharged remains liable to be detained.\n",
              "This must mean that discharge has a different meaning when referring to restricted patients in sections 42(2) and 73(2) from the meaning that it has in sections 23 and 72 when dealing with the discharge of unrestricted patients.\n",
              "Section 23(1) states that a patient who is for the time being liable to be detained shall cease to be so liable if ordered to be discharged by his responsible clinician, the hospital managers or (in certain circumstances) his nearest relative.\n",
              "It contains no power to grant a conditional discharge.\n",
              "Section 72 deals with the tribunals powers to discharge non-restricted patients who are liable to be detained and also confers no power to impose a conditional discharge.\n",
              "Discharge in sections 23 or 72 must therefore mean an absolute discharge, not only from detention but also from the liability to be detained.\n",
              "On the other hand, discharge in sections 42(2) and 73(2) when referring to the conditional discharge of restricted patients, cannot mean discharge from the liability to be detained, because the patient remains liable to be detained.\n",
              "It must therefore mean discharge from the hospital in which the patient is currently detained.\n",
              "Does it therefore follow, as Elias J considered, and the Court of Appeal agreed, that it must mean discharge from any sort of detention?\n",
              "In Secretary of State for Justice v RB [2010] UKUT 454 (AAC), the Upper Tribunal (Carnwath LJ, HHJ Sycamore and UTJ Rowland), held that it did not and that it was not bound by PH to hold that it did (para 54).\n",
              "In its view: The premise for exercise of the tribunals powers is that the patient has previously been lawfully detained (so that article 5 has been complied with); but that he does not now need to be detained in a hospital and that some other form of accommodation is appropriate, subject to the possibility of recall.\n",
              "The next step is to devise the conditions.\n",
              "At that stage, it is hard to see why the question whether the conditions would amount to detention for the purposes of article 5 should come into it.\n",
              "Even if they do amount to such detention, there will be no breach of article 5 because the 1983 Act makes provision for the procedural safeguards guaranteed by article 5.\n",
              "The tribunals concern should be simply to decide what is necessary for the well-being and protection of the patient, and the protection of the public and to satisfy themselves that the patient is willing to comply with the conditions and to that extent consents to them.\n",
              "We see no reason why Parliament should have wished them to concern with themselves with the fine distinctions which may arise under the Strasbourg case law on detention.\n",
              "(para 53) The only qualification was that the conditions could not impose detention in a hospital because, by definition, the tribunal had to have held that it was not satisfied that the criteria for such detention existed (para 55) (see para 10 above).\n",
              "The Court of Appeal did not agree: B v Secretary of State for Justice [2011] EWCA Civ 1608; [2012] 1 WLR 2043.\n",
              "The only form of detention of restriction order patients which was authorised by the MHA was detention in a hospital for medical treatment.\n",
              "Such an invasion of the fundamental common law right to liberty should not be read into the general words of section 73.\n",
              "This would be contrary to the principle of legality: R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Simms [2000] 2 AC 115.\n",
              "It would conflict with the scheme of the Act, under which the Secretary of State could approve the patients transfer to another hospital or into guardianship.\n",
              "And the lack of criteria would mean that the detention was not in accordance with the law for the purpose of article 5 of the ECHR.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal adopted the reasoning in Bs case when reaching the same conclusion in this case.\n",
              "As to the ECHR, Mr Lock argues that there is no deprivation of liberty if the patient consents: in Storck v Germany (2005) 43 EHRR 6, the European Court held: the notion of deprivation of liberty within the meaning of article 5(1) does not only comprise the objective element of a persons confinement to a certain limited place for a not negligible length of time.\n",
              "Individuals can only be considered as being deprived of their liberty if, as an additional subjective element, they have not validly consented to the confinement in question.\n",
              "(para 74) The same formulation was repeated by the Grand Chamber in Stanev v Bulgaria (2012) 55 EHRR 22, para 117.\n",
              "Hence, in Storck, although there was a deprivation of liberty in respect of one period of detention in a psychiatric clinic, there was no such deprivation in respect of another, as the patient had consented to being there.\n",
              "But it is also clear from Storck that an initial consent can be withdrawn, for example, where the patient attempts to leave the hospital.\n",
              "And it is clear from later decisions, such as Buzadji v Moldova (Application No 23755/07), Grand Chamber Judgment of 5 July 2016, that consent given in circumstances where the choice is between greater and lesser forms of deprivation of liberty - there between detention in prison and detention under house arrest - may be no real consent at all.\n",
              "It is, of course, an irony, not lost on the judges who have decided these cases, that the Secretary of State for Justice is relying on the protection of liberty in article 5 in support of an argument that the patient should remain detained in conditions of greater security than would be the case were he to be conditionally discharged into the community.\n",
              "It is, however, difficult to extract the principle of the least restrictive alternative from the case law under article 5.\n",
              "This has not concerned itself with the conditions of the patients detention (which may raise issues under article 3 or 8), as long as the place of detention is appropriate to the ground upon which the patient is detained: thus, in Ashingdane v United Kingdom (1985) 7 EHRR 528, the court rejected a complaint that the patient should have been transferred from Broadmoor to a more open hospital setting much earlier than he was.\n",
              "Mr Lock also argues that there is unjustified discrimination between a patient who has and a patient who lacks the capacity to decide for himself.\n",
              "If the patient lacks capacity, the Court of Protection can authorise a deprivation of liberty in accordance with the sort of care plan which is envisaged in this case, provided that it is in his best interests, whereas if the patient has capacity, the FtT has no power to do so, even with his consent.\n",
              "This is a new point, perhaps prompted by the obiter dictum in the Court of Appeal (at para 35), to the effect that the FtTs power to defer a decision might be used to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court of Protection to authorise the deprivation of liberty of an incapacitated patient under section 16 of the MCA.\n",
              "The Court of Protection cannot authorise the deprivation of liberty of an incapacitated person who is ineligible within the meaning of Schedule 1A to the MCA, section 16A (as inserted by section 50 of, and Schedule 8 to, the 2007 Act).\n",
              "A restricted patient who is actually detained in hospital is ineligible (falling within Case A in para 2).\n",
              "A restricted patient who is conditionally discharged from hospital falls either within Case B or Case C and is not wholly ineligible.\n",
              "A deprivation of liberty whose purpose consists wholly or mainly in medical treatment in hospital cannot be authorised, but a deprivation for other purposes can be authorised, provided that it is not inconsistent with the requirements of their MHA regime.\n",
              "Whether the Court of Protection could authorise a future deprivation, once the FtT has granted a conditional discharge, and whether the FtT could defer its decision for this purpose, are not issues which it would be appropriate for this court to decide at this stage in these proceedings.\n",
              "Assuming that both are possible, and therefore that there might be an incompatibility with article 14, read either with article 5 or with article 8, it would make no difference to the outcome of this case.\n",
              "The outcome of this case depends upon whether it is possible to read the words discharge subject to conditions in section 42(2) (dealing with the Secretary of States powers) and conditional discharge in section 73(2) (dealing with the FtTs powers) as including the power to impose conditions which amount to a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of article 5.\n",
              "Conditional discharge: what does it mean?\n",
              "The MHA is silent: it says nothing about the type or content of the conditions which may be imposed by the Secretary of State or the FtT. In this respect it has remained unchanged since the 1959 Act.\n",
              "There are several possibilities: (1) that the FtT cannot impose a condition of detention in a hospital but the Secretary of State may do so; (2) that neither may do so; (3) that both may impose a condition of detention in a place which is not a hospital within the meaning of the MHA whether or not the patient consents; (4) that both may do so but only if the patient consents; and (5) that neither may do so.\n",
              "There is of course the argument that a condition which amounts to a detention or deprivation of liberty could nonetheless serve the rehabilitative purpose of the power of conditional discharge.\n",
              "Just as there is nothing in the MHA which permits it, there is nothing in the MHA which prohibits it.\n",
              "The thinking of the experienced Upper Tribunal in RB (para 21 above) is worthy of respect.\n",
              "The main textual argument in favour of a power to impose such a condition is that a conditionally discharged patient remains liable to be detained within the meaning of the MHA (see para 18 above).\n",
              "As such, he is more akin to a hospital patient who has been given leave of absence than to a patient who is subject to a community treatment order.\n",
              "Discharge therefore cannot mean discharge from compulsion.\n",
              "Although it must mean discharge from the hospital where he is currently detained, it need not mean any more than that, and so could encompass a range of possible arrangements.\n",
              "Furthermore, although it is clear that the FtT cannot impose a condition of detention in a hospital for treatment, because by definition the FtT is not satisfied that the grounds for such detention exist (para 10 above), the same is not true of the Secretary of State.\n",
              "He has power to discharge the patient conditionally irrespective of whether the grounds for detention in hospital still exist.\n",
              "Moreover, if there is power to impose such a condition, it is difficult to see why the patients consent should be a pre-requisite.\n",
              "The patients willingness to comply with the conditions is always, of course, a highly relevant factor in deciding whether he is suitable for discharge; but this is a practical rather than a legal requirement.\n",
              "Yet no-one in these proceedings has suggested that there is power to impose such a condition without the patients consent.\n",
              "On the other hand, there are compelling reasons not to construe sections 42(2) and 73(2) in such a way.\n",
              "The first reason is one of high principle: the power to deprive a person of his liberty is by definition an interference with his fundamental right to liberty of the person.\n",
              "This engages the rule of statutory construction known as the principle of legality, as explained in the well-known words of Lord Hoffmann in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Simms [2000] 2 AC 115, at 131: the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost.\n",
              "Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words.\n",
              "This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process.\n",
              "In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual.\n",
              "The words of sections 42(2) and 73(2) are about as general as it is possible to be.\n",
              "Parliament was not asked to consider whether they included a power to impose a different form of detention from that provided for in the MHA, without any equivalent of the prescribed criteria for detention in a hospital, let alone any of the prescribed procedural safeguards.\n",
              "While it could be suggested that the FtT process is its own safeguard, the same is not the case with the Secretary of State, who is in a position to impose whatever conditions he sees fit.\n",
              "The second reason is one of practicality.\n",
              "The patients continued co-operation is crucial to the success of any rehabilitation plan.\n",
              "There is, as the FtT found in this case, always a concern that the patients willingness to comply is motivated more by his desire to get out of hospital than by a desire to stay in whatever community setting he is placed.\n",
              "As Holman J pointed out in SH (para 13 above), the MHA confers no coercive powers over conditionally discharged patients.\n",
              "Breach of the conditions is not a criminal offence.\n",
              "It is not even an automatic ground for recall to hospital, although it may well lead to this.\n",
              "But a recalled patient cannot be kept in hospital if the grounds for detaining him there are not satisfied.\n",
              "The patient could withdraw his consent to the deprivation at any time and demand to be released.\n",
              "It is possible to bind oneself contractually not to revoke consent to a temporary deprivation of liberty: the best-known examples are the passenger on a ferry to a defined destination in Robinson v Balmain New Ferry Co Ltd [1910] AC 295 and the miner going down the mine for a defined shift in Herd v Weardale Steel, Coal and Coke Co Ltd [1915] AC 67.\n",
              "But that is not the situation here: there is no contract by which the patient is bound.\n",
              "This leads to the third and perhaps most compelling set of reasons against such a power: it would be contrary to the whole scheme of the MHA.\n",
              "That Act provides in detail for only two forms of detention: (1) detention for no more than 36 hours in a place of safety, which may be a hospital, under sections 135 and 136; and (2) detention in a hospital under the civil powers contained in sections 2 (for assessment), 3 (for treatment) and 4 (for assessment in an emergency); or under a court order made in criminal proceedings under sections 35 (remand to hospital for report), 36 (remand to hospital for treatment), 37 (hospital order), 38 (interim hospital order), 41 (restriction order), and 45A (hospital and limitation directions, as inserted by section 46 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997); or under the Secretary of States directions under sections 47 (transfer of persons imprisoned under criminal powers) or 48 (transfer of persons imprisoned under civil powers).\n",
              "In each of those cases, the Act gives specific powers, both to convey the patient to the hospital or a place of safety and to detain him there: see sections 135(3) and 136(2) for detention in a place of safety; section 6(2) for detention in hospital under civil powers; sections 35(9) and 36(8) for remands to hospital for report or treatment; section 40(1) and (2) for a hospital order (with or without a restriction order) and an interim hospital order; section 45B(1) for a hospital and limitation direction; and section 47(3) for prisoner transfers.\n",
              "There is no equivalent express power to convey a conditionally discharged restricted patient to the place where he is required to live or to detain him there.\n",
              "If the MHA had contemplated that such a patient could be detained, it is inconceivable that equivalent provision would not have been made for that purpose.\n",
              "The MHA also makes detailed provision for the retaking of people who absent themselves from the place of safety or hospital where they are detained.\n",
              "A person authorised to be detained in a place of safety is deemed to be in legal custody and the person authorised to detain him has all the powers of a constable for that purpose (section 137(1) and (2)).\n",
              "If he escapes from legal custody, he may be retaken by that person or by any constable or Approved Mental Health Professional (section 138(1)).\n",
              "For hospital patients, as already explained (para 18 above), the MHA draws a distinction between being detained and being liable to be detained.\n",
              "A patient who is granted leave of absence and a conditionally discharged restricted patient remain liable to be detained but are not in fact detained under the MHA (at least unless the responsible clinician has directed that a patient given leave of absence remain in custody, under section 17(3)).\n",
              "The MHA contains elaborate provisions for recovering patients who are absent without leave.\n",
              "These are: patients who have absented themselves from the hospital where they are detained without having been granted leave of absence under section 17; patients who fail to return to hospital from leave when they should have done; patients on leave who have been recalled to hospital; and patients who break a condition of residence in their leave of absence (MHA, section 18(1)).\n",
              "A conditionally discharged patient who is recalled to hospital by the Secretary of State is also treated as if he were absent without leave for the purpose of the powers in section 18 (MHA, section 42(4)(b)).\n",
              "Patients who are absent without leave may be taken into custody and returned to hospital (the hospital where they were previously detained or, in the case of a conditionally discharged restricted patient, the hospital specified in the Secretary of States warrant of recall) by any police officer, any Approved Mental Health Professional, or by anyone on the staff of or authorised by that hospital (section 18(2)).\n",
              "Thus a conditionally discharged restricted patient is not liable to be taken into custody and returned anywhere unless and until he is recalled to hospital by the Secretary of State.\n",
              "Merely absenting himself from the place where he is required to live is not enough.\n",
              "Once again, if the MHA had contemplated that he might be detained as a condition of his discharge, it is inconceivable that it would not have applied the same regime to such a patient as it applies to a patient granted leave of absence under section 17.\n",
              "Added to those considerations is another which was influential with the Court of Appeal.\n",
              "A hospital order patient (including a patient on leave of absence) can apply to the FtT once within the second six months of his detention and once within every 12-month period thereafter.\n",
              "A conditionally discharged restricted patient who has not been recalled to hospital can only apply once within the second 12 months of his discharge and once within every two-year period thereafter.\n",
              "At the very least, this is an indication that it was not thought that such patients required the same degree of protection as did those deprived of their liberty; and this again is an indication that it was not contemplated that they could be deprived of their liberty by the imposition of conditions.\n",
              "Conclusion\n",
              "For all those reasons, I conclude that the MHA does not permit either the FtT or the Secretary of State to impose conditions amounting to detention or a deprivation of liberty upon a conditionally discharged restricted patient.\n",
              "It follows that this appeal must be dismissed.\n",
              "The making of a hospital order under section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983, coupled with a restriction order under section 41, is a power given to the senior criminal courts (the Crown Court) in relation to offenders convicted of offences which carry sentences of imprisonment.\n",
              "The power is designed to provide an alternative to (probably but not invariably lengthy) imprisonment in the case of an offender who is mentally disordered.\n",
              "A restriction order can be imposed only, as section 41 explicitly says, where it is necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm, that is to say where the offender poses a risk of serious harm to the public: R v Birch (1989) 90 Cr App R 78.\n",
              "No one doubts that the machinery now in place for the making of this combination of orders, and for subsequent review by the FTT, complies with the requirements of article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n",
              "That article, as is well known, specifically contemplates legitimate detention both of persons convicted before a criminal court (article 5(1)(a)) and of those who are of unsound mind, whether convicted or not (article 5(1)(e)).\n",
              "The prime purpose of this combination of orders is thus the protection of the public.\n",
              "Another is, plainly, the treatment and if possible rehabilitation of the offender, since then the risk of serious harm to the public may be reduced or, sometimes, eventually removed.\n",
              "Recovery and rehabilitation are, inevitably, very likely to be progressive and/or partial, rather than instantaneous or complete.\n",
              "If the treatment progresses to the point where the nature of the detention can be relaxed, consistently with the continued protection of the public, it is very plainly in the public interest that it should be.\n",
              "The mechanism contemplated by the Mental Health Act for this relaxation, where it is appropriate, is conditional discharge.\n",
              "The irony so cogently pointed out by Lady Hale at para 24 is that in this case the contention which invokes article 5 ECHR has the result, if it is correct, that a restricted patient who has made sufficient progress for his conditions of detention to be relaxed but not entirely removed, cannot be conditionally discharged to a less severe form of detention.\n",
              "He will, very likely, instead remain in detention in hospital, because in the absence of conditions ensuring public safety it will not be possible for the FTT to say that it is not satisfied that his condition warrants his detention there (section 72(1)(b)(i) and (ii) as applied to restricted patients by section 73(1)(a)).\n",
              "This will be so, on the argument of the Secretary of State, even if everyone is agreed that the protection of the public would sufficiently be safeguarded by the relaxed conditions, and even if, as here, the offender actively seeks the relaxed form of detention.\n",
              "The two arguments which Lady Hale finds lead inevitably to this unsatisfactory result are one of legality and the other of practical construction of the scheme of the Mental Health Act.\n",
              "If they do indeed lead inevitably to this result, then of course they must prevail.\n",
              "It does not seem to me that they do.\n",
              "Lord Hoffmanns celebrated formulation of the rule of legality in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Simms [2000] 2 AC 115 at 131 must not be watered down.\n",
              "Fundamental rights are not to be taken away by a side- wind, or by ambiguous or unspecific words.\n",
              "The right to liberty is a paradigm example.\n",
              "But what is in question here is not the removal of liberty from someone who is unrestrained.\n",
              "The restricted patient under consideration is, by definition, deprived of his liberty by the combination of hospital order and restriction order.\n",
              "That deprivation of liberty is lawful, and Convention-compliant.\n",
              "If he is released from the hospital and relaxed conditions of detention are substituted by way of conditional discharge, he cannot properly be said to be being deprived of his liberty.\n",
              "On the contrary, the existing deprivation of liberty is being modified, and a lesser deprivation substituted.\n",
              "The authority for his detention remains the original combination of orders, from the consequences of which he is only conditionally discharged.\n",
              "This was the reasoning of the Upper Tribunal in Secretary of State for Justice v RB [2010] UKUT 454 (AAC), in the passage set out by Lady Hale at para 21.\n",
              "It seems to me that it was clearly right.\n",
              "It might be otherwise if the proposed conditions to be attached to discharge were to amount to a greater level of detention than is authorised by the hospital and restriction orders.\n",
              "If one were to hypothesise an improbable scenario in which a FTT were to be asked to impose a condition which amounted, for example, to solitary and isolated confinement, such a question might arise, and with it the application of the Simms principle.\n",
              "But the present case is not suggested to involve any potential conditions which are other than a relaxation of the detention to which MM is otherwise subject in the hospital.\n",
              "The position of a restricted patient subject to a court order for detention in a secure hospital is not comparable to that of the unconvicted defendant in Buzadji v Moldova, 5 July 2016 (Application No 23755/07).\n",
              "There is no reason to doubt that a deprivation of liberty is involved if a defendant awaiting trial is given, in effect, the choice whether to be remanded in custody or to avoid such remand by consenting to house arrest.\n",
              "Such a defendant is otherwise at liberty.\n",
              "A restricted patient who seeks relaxation of his detention conditions is not.\n",
              "It is necessary to confront the suggested practical and textual objections.\n",
              "(a) The Act specifically provides for conditional discharge.\n",
              "(b) For the reasons given by Lady Hale at paras 19 and 20 discharge in the context of a restricted patient must mean discharge from the hospital in which he is currently detained.\n",
              "(c) Everyone agrees that the power to order conditional discharge enables the FTT (or the Secretary of State) to impose conditions beyond that of liability to recall.\n",
              "Such conditions might include co-operation with treatment, attending appointments and keeping in touch with supervisors, the regular taking of medicine, perhaps keeping away from specified people or places or abstaining from specified practices.\n",
              "The only issue is whether if the conditions (considered outwith the context of an existing restriction order) meet the Cheshire West test of deprivation of liberty, they become impermissible (Surrey County Council v P; Cheshire West and Chester Council v P [2014] AC 896).\n",
              "(d) There clearly is a risk that a patient who initially professed his consent to conditions meeting the Cheshire West test might subsequently change his mind.\n",
              "That may well be a particular risk with a patient who is mentally disordered.\n",
              "There are indeed no specific provisions in the Mental Health Act, if this happens, for taking him into custody and restoring him to the place where his conditions require him to live.\n",
              "But what the Act does do is to authorise the Secretary of State to recall him to hospital (section 73(4)(a)).\n",
              "If he is recalled, that triggers the express provision in section 42(4)(b) which treats him henceforth as absent without leave, and then the various provisions of the Act for his being taken into custody and returned to the hospital come into operation.\n",
              "Whether or not the Act might have provided additional powers, these are perfectly viable and rational remedies for the risk of failure to comply with conditions.\n",
              "It may well be that it was not thought appropriate to vest in those managing some place of lesser security where the patients conditions required him to live, the same powers as those possessed by a secure hospital.\n",
              "(e) Moreover, the same risk of later refusal to comply with conditions will exist where the conditions do not approach the Cheshire West threshold, and it is met with the same remedy or sanction.\n",
              "If the patient, having initially professed himself keen to comply with medication rules, or anxious to avoid contact with particularly vulnerable persons, then decides not to comply with the conditions, then what the Act contemplates is that his case will be assessed by the Secretary of State who will either decide to recall him, or will decline to do so.\n",
              "If he does recall him, there are then ample powers to enforce the recall.\n",
              "Short of that, there are no powers to compel him to obey the conditions; no criminal offence is committed and he cannot physically be compelled to obey.\n",
              "The position is thus the same for conditions which meet the Cheshire West test and for those which do not.\n",
              "(f) Some reliance was placed upon the fact that the interval stipulated in the Act in which application to the FTT can be made is greater for a restricted patient who has been conditionally discharged than for a restricted patient who has not.\n",
              "The latter is entitled to apply within the period 6-12 months from the making of the hospital and restriction orders, and thereafter at 12- month intervals: section 70.\n",
              "The conditionally discharged patient is subject to a longer interval, namely within the period 12-24 months of discharge and bi-ennially thereafter: section 75(2).\n",
              "If, however, a conditionally discharged restricted patient is recalled to hospital, his entitlement to apply to the tribunal reverts to the same intervals as before his discharge: section 75(1).\n",
              "This can be said to be some indication that Parliament did not think that a conditionally discharged restricted patient needed the same protection by way of entitlement to make further application to the tribunal as a patient who either had not made any previous application or whose applications for discharge, conditional or otherwise, had been refused.\n",
              "But that is not surprising, given the difference between the two cases.\n",
              "The conditionally discharged prisoner will, by definition, have had a recent determination of the tribunal relaxing his manner of detention.\n",
              "It is going further than is justified to read into this difference a Parliamentary assumption that the conditions applied on conditional discharge could never amount to ones which, if considered without the background of an extant order for detention in hospital, would meet the Cheshire West test for detention.\n",
              "Whilst this consideration is of some limited weight, I do not think that it can prevail against the scheme of the Act as set out above, for relaxation of detention by means of conditions attached to discharge.\n",
              "Nor do I think that any help can be derived from the intervals prescribed for the different case of a non-restricted hospital order patient, which apply equally to those still actually detained and those on leave of absence.\n",
              "For these reasons it seems to me that the FTT does indeed have the power, if it considers it right in all the circumstances, to impose conditions upon the discharge of a restricted patient which, if considered out of the context of an existing court order for detention, would meet the Cheshire West test, at least so long as the loss of liberty involved is not greater than that already authorised by the hospital and restriction orders.\n",
              "Whether it is right to do so in any particular case is a different matter.\n",
              "The power to do so does not seem to me to depend on the consent of the (capacitous) patient.\n",
              "His consent, if given, and the prospect of it being reliably maintained, will of course be very relevant practical considerations on the question whether such an order ought to be made, and will have sufficient prospect of being effective.\n",
              "Tribunals will at that stage have to scrutinise the reality of the consent, but the fact that it is given in the face of the less palatable alternative of remaining detained in hospital does not, as it seems to me, necessarily rob it of reality.\n",
              "Many decisions have to be made to consent to a less unpalatable option of two or several: a simple example is where consent is required to deferment of sentence, in a case where the offence would otherwise merit an immediate custodial sentence.\n",

              "      <td id=\"T_cc1de_row5_col0\" class=\"data row5 col0\" >This appeal concerns an application made by the appellant, Professor Shanks OBE FRS FREng, for compensation under section 40 of the Patents Act 1977 (the 1977 Act) on the basis that the patents for an invention which he made in 1982 have been of outstanding benefit to his employer, the third respondent, Unilever UK Central Resources Ltd (CRL), and that he is entitled to a fair share of that benefit.\n",
              "The appeal raises important issues concerning the circumstances in which such compensation may be awarded and how the amount of that compensation is to be determined.\n",
              "The facts\n",
              "Professor Shanks was employed by CRL from May 1982 to October 1986 and was assigned to its Colworth research laboratories in Bedfordshire.\n",
              "He initially received a salary of 18,000 per annum and a Volvo car.\n",
              "His brief was to develop biosensors for use in process control and process engineering.\n",
              "In July 1982 Professor Shanks visited Professor Anthony Turner and Professor John Higgins at Cranfield University and there he learned of the work they were carrying out into the use of biosensors for monitoring diabetes.\n",
              "As a result of this visit Professor Shanks became interested in the possibility of using re-usable or disposable devices incorporating biosensors for diagnostic applications and in a report dated 1 August 1982 entitled Report on new opportunities afforded by electronic sensors he identified a number of new product opportunities, one of which was a limited re-use or disposable sensor for monitoring glucose, insulin or immunoglobulin levels in diabetics.\n",
              "It was at about this time that Professor Shanks conceived his invention.\n",
              "He had often observed how a droplet of liquid placed on the edge of the glass plates of a liquid crystal display (LCD) was drawn by capillary action into the 10-micron gap between them, and he realised the same phenomenon would occur with other liquids such as blood or urine.\n",
              "He also appreciated how it could be used with etched or printed planar electrodes and enzyme electrochemical techniques he had seen at Cranfield, and in this way provide a system for measuring the glucose concentration in blood, serum or urine.\n",
              "In October 1982 Professor Shanks built the first prototype of his invention at home using Mylar film and slides from his daughters toy microscope kit, and bulldog clips to hold the assembly together.\n",
              "It has since become known as the Electrochemical Capillary Fill Device or ECFD.\n",
              "He also developed a similar system which uses fluorescence rather than conductivity and this has become known as the Fluorescent Capillary Fill Device or FCFD.\n",
              "CRL at that time employed all of the Unilever groups UK-based research staff.\n",
              "It was not a trading company and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Unilever plc.\n",
              "Unilever plc and Unilever NV were parallel parent companies of the Unilever group and were listed on the London and Amsterdam stock exchanges respectively, but the business of the group was run as a single entity.\n",
              "Save where from the context otherwise appears, I will refer to the Unilever group as Unilever.\n",
              "It is accepted by Professor Shanks that the rights to his inventions belonged to CRL from the outset pursuant to section 39(1) of the 1977 Act.\n",
              "CRL assigned all these rights to Unilever plc for 100.\n",
              "Unilever plc retained the rights for the UK, Australia and Canada but assigned the rights for elsewhere in Europe, Japan and the USA to Unilever NV, again for 100.\n",
              "Unilever NV later assigned the rights for the USA to a company which later became Unilever Patent Holdings BV.\n",
              "On 13 June 1984 Unilever plc filed UK patent application 8415018 (the priority application).\n",
              "It was entitled Devices for Use in Chemical Test Procedures and was directed to both the ECFD and the FCFD technologies.\n",
              "Professor Shanks was named as inventor.\n",
              "On 12 June 1985 European patent application 0170375 was filed claiming priority from the priority application.\n",
              "It related only to the ECFD technology and was filed by Unilever plc for the UK and by Unilever NV for various other contracting states.\n",
              "Corresponding patent applications were filed in Australia, Canada, Japan and the USA.\n",
              "It was in relation to the patents which were granted on all of these applications (the Shanks patents) that Professor Shanks made the application for compensation which is the subject of these proceedings.\n",
              "Unilever was not itself interested in developing a business in the field of glucose testing for this would have required it to compete with companies which were established in this therapeutic sector.\n",
              "Consequently, relatively little was done to develop the ECFD technology after the end of 1984.\n",
              "Indeed, it was regarded by Unilever as far from a key technology.\n",
              "Instead, until 1986, Unilever and Professor Shanks focused on the FCFD technology which had potential application in areas of relevance to Unilevers existing businesses.\n",
              "Professor Shanks left Unilever in October 1986 and in October 1987 Unilever sold the FCFD technology, and the patents it held relating to it, to Ares-Serono Inc. Ares-Serono also took an option on the ECFD technology but did not exercise it.\n",
              "In the years that followed Unilever carried out a good deal of work in the field of pregnancy and fertility testing where it developed commercially successful products.\n",
              "Nevertheless, some research into glucose testing was carried out from 1987 to 1994 and, based primarily upon the work of Professor Brian Birch, Unilever applied for and was granted further patents (the Birch patents).\n",
              "It also maintained the Shanks patents.\n",
              "The glucose testing market expanded considerably in the late 1990s and 2000s, however; and biosensors incorporating the ECFD technology played an important role in this.\n",
              "Indeed, the ECFD technology eventually appeared in most glucose testing products.\n",
              "It also became apparent that, although not vital, it was a technology that most of the significant companies in the field were willing to pay millions of pounds to use.\n",
              "Unilever never considered licensing of patent rights to be a key part of its business.\n",
              "Its main purpose in having patents was to use them to protect its existing commercial activities.\n",
              "Cross-licensing of unexploited patents was of secondary importance and out-licensing was of even less interest.\n",
              "Consequently, the resources it devoted to the activity of out-licensing were relatively limited and, in most cases, the prospective licensees of the Shanks patents contacted Unilever and initiated licensing discussions themselves.\n",
              "However, as I have mentioned, Unilever did keep the Shanks patents in force and it needed significant effort and skill to conduct the licensing negotiations, albeit not to the extent a dedicated licensing team would have provided.\n",
              "In the end seven licences (or sets of licences) of the Shanks patents were granted by Unilever for a total consideration of about 20.3m.\n",
              "The hearing officer thought this figure should be discounted to reflect the inclusion of the Birch patents in all but one of the licences, producing a net figure attributable to the Shanks patents of about 19.55m.\n",
              "In 1994 management responsibility for the Shanks and Birch patents (and various other patents) was transferred to Unipath, another Unilever company.\n",
              "In addition, Unipath took on the bulk of Unilevers medical diagnostics business, including its commercially successful products in the fields of pregnancy and fertility testing.\n",
              "In 2001 Unipath and the Shanks and the Birch patents (and the benefit of the licences under these patents) were sold to Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc (IMI).\n",
              "The hearing officer found that, of the price paid by IMI, about 5m was attributable to the Shanks patents.\n",
              "Unilevers total earnings from the Shanks patents therefore amounted to around 24.55m.\n",
              "The hearing officer estimated that Unilever had incurred costs in prosecuting, maintaining and licensing the patents of about 250,000.\n",
              "It followed that Unilevers net benefit from the patents was about 24.3m which the hearing officer rounded down to 24m.\n",
              "The history of the proceedings\n",
              "Professor Shanks made his application for compensation on 9 June 2006.\n",
              "It came on for hearing before Mr Julyan Elbro, the hearing officer acting for the Comptroller General of Patents (the Comptroller), in March 2012.\n",
              "The hearing lasted for nine days between March and May of that year.\n",
              "On 21 June 2013 the hearing officer issued his decision: BL O/259/13.\n",
              "He found that, having regard to the size and nature of Unilevers business, the benefit provided by the Shanks patents fell short of being outstanding.\n",
              "The hearing officer went on to consider what a fair share of the benefit would have been had he considered it to be outstanding.\n",
              "He had regard to the various matters set out in section 41 of the 1977 Act and concluded that 5% would have been appropriate, amounting to about 1.2m.\n",
              "He declined to increase this figure to take into account the time value of money.\n",
              "Professor Shanks appealed to the High Court against the hearing officers decision.\n",
              "The appeal was heard by Arnold J and he gave judgment on 23 May 2014: [2014] EWHC 1647 (Pat); [2014] RPC 29.\n",
              "He dismissed the appeal, holding that the hearing officer had made no error of principle in finding that the Shanks patents were not of outstanding benefit to Unilever.\n",
              "However, he continued, had he come to the opposite conclusion, he would have found that a fair share of the benefit would have been only 3%.\n",
              "He also held that it was not appropriate to take into account the time value of money and that in assessing the benefit of the Shanks patents to Unilever, the sums it had received should be discounted to reflect the payment of corporation tax.\n",
              "An appeal to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed: Shanks v Unilever plc (No 2) [2017] EWCA Civ 2; [2017] Bus LR 883; [2017] RPC 15.\n",
              "The court (Patten, Briggs and Sales LJJ) agreed with Arnold J that the hearing officer had made no error of principle in considering the issue of outstanding benefit.\n",
              "However, the court unanimously overturned Arnold Js finding in relation to the deduction of corporation tax and, by a majority (Briggs and Sales LJJ), held that there would be cases where the change in the value of money over time would have to be recognised in determining whether the benefit was outstanding, and that it was likely to be relevant in assessing what amounted to a fair share of that benefit.\n",
              "The issues\n",
              "This further appeal now gives rise to the following issues: i) What are the principles governing the assessment of outstanding benefit to an employer and did the hearing officer apply them correctly? ii) How should a fair share of an outstanding benefit be assessed and were the hearing officer and Arnold J wrong in their assessment?\n",
              "I must also consider whether, in assessing what amounts to a fair share of an outstanding benefit, it is appropriate to take into account the time value of money and any liability of the employer for tax.\n",
              "The legal framework\n",
              "Employees inventions are addressed in sections 39 to 43 of the 1977 Act.\n",
              "These provisions have been amended by the Patents Act 2004 but only in relation to patents applied for after 1 January 2005.\n",
              "We are therefore concerned in this appeal with these sections in their form prior to their amendment by the Patents Act 2004.\n",
              "Section 39 deals with the right to an invention made by an employee: 39(1) Notwithstanding anything in any rule of law, an invention made by an employee shall, as between him and his employer, be taken to belong to his employer for the purposes of this Act and all other purposes if - (a) it was made in the course of the normal duties of the employee or in the course of duties falling outside his normal duties, but specifically assigned to him, and the circumstances in either case were such that an invention might reasonably be expected to result from the carrying out of his duties; or (b) the invention was made in the course of the duties of the employee and, at the time of making the invention, because of the nature of his duties and the particular responsibilities arising from the nature of his duties he had a special obligation to further the interests of the employers undertaking.\n",
              "(2) Any other invention made by an employee shall, as between him and his employer, be taken for those purposes to belong to the employee.\n",
              "There have been cases where it has been difficult to decide whether an invention belongs to an inventor or his employer, but this is not one of them.\n",
              "As I have mentioned, there has never been any dispute between the parties that the invention described in European patent application 0170375 belonged to CRL, as Professor Shanks employer, from the outset, whether under paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (1) of section 39.\n",
              "He was, as the hearing officer held, employed to invent.\n",
              "Section 40 then makes provision for the payment of compensation to an employee in particular circumstances.\n",
              "In its unamended form it reads, so far as relevant: 40(1) Where it appears to the court or the comptroller on an application made by an employee within the prescribed period that the employee has made an invention belonging to the employer for which a patent has been granted, that the patent is (having regard among other things to the size and nature of the employers undertaking) of outstanding benefit to the employer and that by reason of those facts it is just that the employee should be awarded compensation to be paid by the employer, the court or the comptroller may award him such compensation of an amount determined under section 41 below.\n",
              "(2) Where it appears to the court or the comptroller on an application made by an employee within the prescribed period that - a patent has been granted for an invention made (a) by and belonging to the employee; (b) his rights in the invention, or in any patent or application for a patent for the invention, have since the appointed day been assigned to the employer or an exclusive licence under the patent or application has since the appointed day been granted to the employer; (c) the benefit derived by the employee from the contract of assignment, assignation or grant or any ancillary contract (the relevant contract) is inadequate in relation to the benefit derived by the employer from the patent; and (d) by reason of those facts it is just that the employee should be awarded compensation to be paid by the employer in addition to the benefit derived from the relevant contract; the court or the comptroller may award him such compensation of an amount determined under section 41 below.\n",
              "Section 40 therefore deals with two different cases.\n",
              "In the first, the invention belongs to the employer from the outset.\n",
              "In the second, the invention belongs initially to the employee but his or her rights in the invention or any patent or patent application for the invention are subsequently assigned or exclusively licensed to the employer.\n",
              "In this appeal we are concerned with the first and so section 40(1).\n",
              "In such a case the employee may be awarded compensation if the invention is of outstanding benefit to the employer.\n",
              "Of relevance to both cases are section 43(4) which provides that references to a patent and to a patent being granted are references to a patent and its being granted whether under the law of the United Kingdom or the law in force in any other country or under any treaty or international convention; and section 43(7) which provides that benefit means benefit in money or moneys worth.\n",
              "The key amendment introduced by the Patents Act 2004 makes compensation payable when the invention (and not just the patent) has been of outstanding benefit.\n",
              "The amount of compensation is to be determined in accordance with section 41.\n",
              "In its unamended form this reads, so far as relevant: 41(1) An award of compensation to an employee under section 40(1) or (2) above in relation to a patent for an invention shall be such as will secure for the employee a fair share (having regard to all the circumstances) of the benefit which the employer has derived, or may reasonably be expected to derive, from the patent or from the assignment, assignation or grant to a person connected with the employer of the property or any right in the invention or the property in, or any right in or under, an application for that patent.\n",
              "(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) above the amount of any benefit derived or expected to be derived by an employer from the assignment, assignation or grant of - (a) the property in, or any right in or under, a patent for the invention or an application for such a patent; or (b) the property or any right in the invention; to a person connected with him shall be taken to be the amount which could reasonably be expected to be so derived by the employer if that person had not been connected with him.\n",
              "(4) In determining the fair share of the benefit to be secured for an employee in respect of a patent for an invention which has always belonged to an employer, the court or the comptroller shall, among other things, take the following matters into account, that is to say - (a) the nature of the employees duties, his remuneration and the other advantages he derives or has derived from his employment or has derived in relation to the invention under this Act; (b) devoted to making the invention; the effort and skill which the employee has (c) the effort and skill which any other person has devoted to making the invention jointly with the employee concerned, and the advice and other assistance contributed by any other employee who is not a joint inventor of the invention; and (d) the contribution made by the employer to the making, developing and working of the invention by the provision of advice, facilities and other assistance, by the provision of opportunities and by his managerial and commercial skill and activities.\n",
              "Section 43(8) provides that section 533 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 is to apply for determining for the purpose of section 41(2) whether one person is connected with another.\n",
              "Entitlement to compensation\n",
              "An employee who makes an invention which belongs to his employer from the outset and for which a patent has been granted is therefore entitled to compensation if he or she establishes: first, that the patent is, having regard among other things to the size and nature of the employers undertaking, of outstanding benefit to the employer; and secondly, that, by reason of these matters, it is just that he or she be awarded compensation.\n",
              "Who is the employer?\n",
              "The starting point for the assessment of whether an employee is entitled to compensation is therefore the identification of the employer.\n",
              "There can be no doubt that, at least in the ordinary case, Parliament intended the term employer to mean the inventors actual employer.\n",
              "Section 39 deals with the ownership of the invention as between the inventor and his or her employer and requires a consideration of the employees duties; section 40 provides for the compensation of employees for certain inventions which may belong initially either to the employer or to the employee and, in an appropriate case, the payment of that compensation by the employer to the employee; and section 41 deals with the assessment of the compensation.\n",
              "In all three cases the employer is the inventors actual employer.\n",
              "What is the benefit?\n",
              "The next task is to identify the benefit in the hands of the employer.\n",
              "This is not explained in section 40(1) which deals with an invention which has always belonged to the employer; nor is it explained in section 40(2) which deals with an invention which initially belonged to the employee.\n",
              "But section 41(1) makes clear that in both cases it is the benefit which the inventors actual employer has derived or may reasonably be expected to derive from the patent, or from the assignment or grant to a person connected with him of any right in the invention or patent or patent application for the invention.\n",
              "Section 41(1) is complemented by section 41(2) which deals further with a disposal to a connected person.\n",
              "This was considered by the Court of Appeal at an earlier stage of these proceedings on an appeal from a decision of Mann J: [2009] EWHC 3164 (Ch); [2010] RPC 11.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal (Longmore LJ, Jacob LJ and Kitchin J) held ([2010] EWCA Civ 1283; [2011] RPC 12) that, in assessing the benefit derived or expected to be derived by an employer from an assignment of the patent to a person connected with him, the court must consider the position of the actual employer and the benefit which the assignee has in fact gained or is expected to gain.\n",
              "There is also one curious feature of section 41(2) which it is convenient to mention at this point.\n",
              "It says it has effect for the purposes of section 41(1) but makes no mention of section 40.\n",
              "Nevertheless, for the legislative scheme to operate effectively, section 41(2) must also have effect for the purposes of section 40 and, in my opinion, it is to be interpreted in that way.\n",
              "As for the assessment of the benefit of the patent, there is no dispute that it means the benefit in the hands of the employer after deduction of any costs to the employer of securing that benefit.\n",
              "Is the benefit outstanding?\n",
              "I now turn to the meaning of the word outstanding in the expression outstanding benefit.\n",
              "In GEC Avionics Ltds Patent [1992] RPC 107, 115, Mr Vivian, for the Comptroller, noted that the statute did not use words such as significant or substantial and said the benefit must be something out of the ordinary and not such as one would normally expect to arise from the results of the duties that the employee is paid for.\n",
              "The employee failed to establish the patent was of outstanding benefit because the employer had received substantial orders for equipment not employing the invention well after its merits were known.\n",
              "In British Steel PLCs Patent [1992] RPC 117, 122, Dr Ferdinando, for the Comptroller, thought the word outstanding implied a superlative.\n",
              "The patent related to an improved valve for controlling the flow of molten metal which was used by the employer at only one site and on one machine.\n",
              "The claim for compensation was rejected because the employee failed to establish a number of the benefits for which he contended, and because the hearing officer felt constrained by the way the case was presented to assess the proven benefit against all of the profits and the whole turnover of the employer, of which it represented only a very small percentage.\n",
              "In Memco-Med Ltds Patent [1992] RPC 403, 414, Aldous J indicated that he did not disagree with the approaches of these hearing officers and said that the word outstanding denoted something special and required the benefit to be more than substantial or good.\n",
              "The case concerned a patent relating to an improved unit for preventing the doors from closing on a person getting into or out of a lift.\n",
              "Sales of the improved unit were of great importance but were all made to one customer and the evidence suggested that the business relationship between the employer and that customer would have been the same whether or not a patent had been granted.\n",
              "So, once again, the claim failed.\n",
              "In Kelly and Chiu v GE Healthcare Ltd [2009] EWHC 181 (Pat); [2009] RPC 12 Floyd J reviewed all of these authorities and, at para 60(iv), summarised the position as he saw it in these terms: Outstanding means something special or out of the ordinary and more than substantial, significant or good.\n",
              "The benefit must be something more than one would normally expect to arise from the duties for which the employee is paid.\n",
              "The Kelly case is of particular interest because the patents in issue were found to be of outstanding benefit to the claimants employer, Amersham, which was subsequently taken over by GE Healthcare Ltd, the defendant.\n",
              "The facts were striking in that, had the patents not existed, Amersham would have faced a financial crisis whereas, with the patents, its business was transformed.\n",
              "The commercial embodiment of the invention of the patents was an imaging agent which cost a little under 2.5m to develop but, with the protection afforded by the patents, achieved sales between 1993 and 2007 having a total value in excess of 1.3 billion.\n",
              "In my view these cases are all helpful to a point as illustrations of circumstances which were found to fall each side of the line.\n",
              "But at the end of the day they provide no substitute for the statutory test which requires the benefit to be outstanding.\n",
              "This is an ordinary English word meaning exceptional or such as to stand out and it refers here to the benefit (in terms of money or moneys worth) of the patent to the employer rather than the degree of inventiveness of the employee.\n",
              "It is, however, both a relative and qualitative term and so I must now consider the context in which the question is to be asked and answered.\n",
              "Put another way, in relation to what must the benefit from the patent be outstanding? Which factors may be taken into account in making that assessment?\n",
              "Here the 1977 Act provides some guidance.\n",
              "It says that the court must have regard among other things to the size and nature of the employers undertaking.\n",
              "But this gives rise to two further questions which were the subject of a good deal of argument before us.\n",
              "What is the employers undertaking for this purpose? And what is the relevance of that undertakings size and nature?\n",
              "The employers undertaking\n",
              "In this context I understand the word undertaking to mean simply a unit or entity which carries on a business activity, and here the undertaking of interest is that of the company or other entity which employs the inventor.\n",
              "In many cases the identification of that undertaking will be comparatively straightforward.\n",
              "It will be the whole or, if it is divided into economic units, the relevant unit of the employers business.\n",
              "So, as Aldous J observed in Memco-Med at p 414 and I agree, the undertaking may be the whole or a division of the employers business.\n",
              "We are concerned in this appeal with a different and more difficult case, however.\n",
              "It is one in which CRL is part of a larger group of companies and where the work carried out by CRLs researchers was exploited by that larger group as a whole.\n",
              "This gives rise to the question whether the relevant undertaking is CRL or the whole or a part of the larger group of which it forms a part, Unilever.\n",
              "The hearing officer rejected the submission made on behalf of Professor Shanks that the employers undertaking was CRL.\n",
              "He said at para 196: In the event, on the facts of this case I find that the reality of the situation is that described by the defendants: regardless of how the various companies in the Unilever group have been structured, researchers at Colworth (employed by CRL) were doing work which was going to be exploited by the group as a whole.\n",
              "Indeed, it is notable that the whole benefit from the Shanks patents was generated by licensing activity operated out of the central Unilever companies.\n",
              "Having regard to the size and nature of the employers undertaking therefore requires me to have regard to whether the benefit from the patents is outstanding in the context of the Unilever group as a whole.\n",
              "Arnold J and the Court of Appeal agreed with the hearing officer.\n",
              "Patten LJ explained at paras 33 and 34 that an assessment of what constituted the undertaking based upon the economic and business realities of the employers organisation was the correct approach.\n",
              "He continued that if one took what he described as a strictly legal approach to the interpretation of the statute it could be said that the employer was CRL but he rejected this as a possible conclusion for two reasons: first, that if what he called the strict legal approach were to govern section 40(1) then it must also apply to section 41(1) with the consequence that the benefit derived from the patents would be limited to the nominal payments CRL received upon their assignment and would not include the sums subsequently received by other companies in the group from licence fees and the sale of Unipath.\n",
              "Secondly, the earlier decision of the Court of Appeal in this case was, in his opinion, only consistent with treating CRLs undertaking as including the other group companies that received these payments.\n",
              "He pointed out that the work carried out by the employees of CRL was intended to enure for the benefit of Unilever as a whole and that he could see no answer to the reasoning of the hearing officer and his conclusion that the relevant undertaking in this case was or included Unilever plc and Unilever NV.\n",
              "Upon this further appeal Mr Patrick Green QC, for Professor Shanks, submits that the hearing officer and the courts below lost sight of the fact that CRL was Professor Shanks employer and that the entire Unilever group could not sensibly be described as CRLs undertaking.\n",
              "Mr Daniel Alexander QC, for Unilever, commends the hearing officers reasoning.\n",
              "He submits that it is unreal to treat CRL as the relevant undertaking because it never generated any material revenues, was not the beneficiary of the royalties in question and is and was simply a service company for the Unilever group.\n",
              "Neither of these interpretations is without difficulty.\n",
              "The submission for Professor Shanks faces the problem that CRL has in reality received no more than a nominal benefit from the patents and certainly nothing that could be described as outstanding.\n",
              "As Mr Alexander fairly says, the real benefits have been received by other Unilever companies.\n",
              "A partial answer to this is provided by section 41(2) which deems the benefit derived from the assignment of a patent to a connected person to be the benefit which could reasonably be expected to be derived if that person had not been connected.\n",
              "True it is that section 41(2) does not in terms apply to section 40(1) but, as I have said, I think it must be interpreted in that way.\n",
              "This is still not a complete answer, however, for the deeming provision does not, on the face of it, apply to the benefit from other patents arising from the work at CRL against which the benefits from the patents in issue may be judged.\n",
              "Mr Green embraces this result, arguing that CRLs actual profits were at most about 2m per year and that judged against this figure, the 24.3m earned from the Shanks patents is plainly outstanding.\n",
              "But that, so it seems to me, is not comparing like with like.\n",
              "It would artificially and unfairly elevate the benefit to CRL from the Shanks patents in relation to any benefit it derived in other ways.\n",
              "The interpretation for which Unilever contends and which was accepted by the hearing officer and on appeal focuses on the phrase the employers undertaking in section 40(1).\n",
              "This, so it is said, is perfectly apt to describe the larger entity of which CRL is a part, that is to say, the whole Unilever group.\n",
              "But the problem with this interpretation is that it strips the phrase from its context.\n",
              "The subsection as a whole is concerned with the benefit of the patent to the employer and the assessment of whether that benefit is, in the hands of the employer, outstanding.\n",
              "Consideration of the size and nature of the employers undertaking is therefore tethered to this assessment.\n",
              "It is not, on the face of it, an inquiry into the value of the benefit to the group of which the employer is a part relative to other unrelated aspects of the groups business.\n",
              "In my judgement the correct approach to the application of section 40 and the one that does least violence to its language lies between these extremes.\n",
              "It is to look at the commercial reality of the situation but to do so, in a case such as the present, from the perspective of the inventors employer.\n",
              "Where, as here, a group company operates a research facility for the benefit of the whole group and the work results in patents which are assigned to other group members for their benefit, the focus of the inquiry into whether any one of those patents is of outstanding benefit to the company must be the extent of the benefit of that patent to the group and how that compares with the benefits derived by the group from other patents for inventions arising from the research carried out by that company.\n",
              "This gives practical and commercial effect to the language of section 41 and involves a comparison of like with like.\n",
              "Furthermore, it is, in my opinion, the approach which sits most comfortably with the next aspect of the analysis, namely the relevance of the size and nature of the employers undertaking.\n",
              "The relevance of size and nature of the employers undertaking\n",
              "Before the Court of Appeal, Unilevers central argument on the issue of outstanding benefit was that 24.3m, though not inconsiderable, was dwarfed by the turnover and profits of Unilever as a whole.\n",
              "As Patten LJ recorded at para 26 of his judgment, Unilever makes a wide range of products from Viennetta ice-cream to deodorants which generate billions of pounds in sales and hundreds of millions of pounds in profits over the life of the patents which relate to them.\n",
              "It was accepted that the rate of return on many if not most of these patents was much lower than on the Shanks patents but that was said not to be enough to make the benefit of the Shanks patents outstanding when regard was had to the size and nature of Unilevers business.\n",
              "This submission found an echo in Mr Alexanders submissions to this court for he took us to a graph of Unilevers profits between 1984 and 2004 against which a plot of the royalty income from the Shanks and Birch patents, displayed on the same scale, was so close to the base line as to be indistinguishable from it.\n",
              "Mr Green characterised this submission before the courts below and in this court as too big to pay.\n",
              "He argued that, were it to be accepted, it would be all but impossible for an employee to establish that the benefit from a patent to a business such as that of Unilever was outstanding and this would be manifestly unjust to employee inventors.\n",
              "This found favour with the Court of Appeal to a point.\n",
              "As Patten LJ explained at para 28, outstanding benefit cannot be determined simply by comparing the income derived from a patent with the overall turnover and profitability of the employers undertaking.\n",
              "But it raises the more fundamental question as to the relevance of the size and nature of an undertaking to the assessment of whether the benefit to it from a patent is outstanding and how these factors should be taken into account.\n",
              "In my judgement there is no single answer to this question.\n",
              "Many different aspects of the size and nature of the employers business may be relevant to the enquiry.\n",
              "For example, the benefit may be more than would normally have been expected to arise from the duties for which the employee was paid; it may have been arrived at without any risk to the business; it may represent an extraordinarily high rate of return; or it may have been the opportunity to develop a new line of business or to engage in unforeseen licensing opportunities.\n",
              "In the circumstances of this case and for the reasons I have given, a highly material consideration must be the extent of the benefit of the Shanks patents to the Unilever group and how that compares with the benefits the group derived from other patents resulting from the work carried out at CRL.\n",
              "In some cases it may be possible to see that a patent has been of outstanding benefit to an employer by looking at the size and profitability of the whole business.\n",
              "In the Kelly case (see paras 37-38 above), for example, the benefits of patent protection went far beyond anything which one would normally expect to arise from the sort of work the employees were doing.\n",
              "The patents protected Amershams business from generic competition and allowed it to make major deals; and sales of the patented product accounted for a large proportion of its profits.\n",
              "In short, the patents transformed its business.\n",
              "Similarly, as Patten LJ explained at para 28, a straightforward comparison of profitability may be sufficient, in the case of a smaller company, to show an outstanding benefit without recourse to wider considerations of the scope of an employees duties or the expectations the employer may have had about the anticipated level of return.\n",
              "I also recognise that a large undertaking may be able to exert greater leverage than a smaller undertaking when negotiating licence fees.\n",
              "This was a matter to which the hearing officer referred in para 207 of his judgment.\n",
              "There he explained and I agree that a particular sum might represent an excellent return for a small undertaking but might not be so regarded by a large undertaking which was in a position to spend substantial sums on litigation to enforce its rights.\n",
              "Much the same might apply to sales of a patented product.\n",
              "A large undertaking might be able to harness its goodwill and sales force in a way that a smaller undertaking could not do.\n",
              "These would be appropriate matters to take into account.\n",
              "On the other hand, I think a tribunal should be very cautious before accepting a submission that a patent has not been of outstanding benefit to an employer simply because it has had no significant impact on its overall profitability or the value of all of its sales.\n",
              "Those profits and sales may have been generated by a range of different products which have nothing to do with the technology the subject of the patent; the parts of the business responsible for them may not have contributed to any commercial success of the patented invention; and they may be a very poor guide to whether the benefit the employer has derived from the patent is out of the ordinary.\n",
              "Indeed, I find it very hard to see how a failure materially to affect the aggregated sales value or overall profitability of the business could, in and of itself, justify a finding that the benefit of a patent has not been outstanding.\n",
              "Tax and the assessment of benefit\n",
              "Arnold J accepted a submission by Unilever that in assessing the benefit it received from the Shanks patents, it was necessary to take into account the amount of tax which it had to pay, and in doing so he placed some reliance on the decision in Celanese International Corpn v BP Chemicals Ltd [1999] RPC 203.\n",
              "There Laddie J held that, in the context of an account of profits derived by a defendant from infringement of a patent, the defendant could only be required to pay over its net profits after payment of corporation tax.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal disagreed with Arnold Js approach and so do I. Section 40(1) is concerned with the assessment of the benefit of the patent to the employer and whether that benefit is outstanding.\n",
              "This exercise is quite different from an assessment of the profits which a defendant has made from its infringing activities and which it has been ordered to disgorge.\n",
              "In this case Dr Osborn, Unilevers expert on this issue, quantified the appropriate reduction to be applied to the benefit Unilever had derived from the patents at 30% on the basis that this was the average rate of corporation tax which it had to pay in the relevant period, as calculated from its accounts.\n",
              "Mr Alexander, for Unilever, submitted that Dr Osborns analysis was reasonable and proportionate and that revenues which had to be paid over in tax, such that they could not be enjoyed by Unilever, could not count as a benefit.\n",
              "I find myself unable to accept Mr Alexanders submission for it seems to me artificially to reduce the size of the benefit before deciding how much compensation should be paid to the employee.\n",
              "In my judgement the first step is to quantify the benefit and the next is to decide how much compensation would secure for the employee a fair share of it.\n",
              "The employee must account for any tax due on that share and the employer must account for any tax due on the balance.\n",
              "The approach for which Mr Alexander contends, on the other hand, would mean that the employer has only to pay to the employee a share of the benefit net of tax but can take the benefit of any available relief from tax in respect of the moneys he has paid, whilst the employee will be liable to account for tax on the moneys that he or she has received.\n",
              "In my judgement the former approach is both fairer and consonant with the legislative purpose of these provisions.\n",
              "It follows that Patten LJ was right to say at para 43 of his judgment that the incidence of tax is a consequence of the benefit rather than a part of it.\n",
              "Assessment of the benefit net of tax would require in every case an investigation of the employers tax position including, among other things, any losses rolled forward.\n",
              "The time value of money\n",
              "Unilever received payments of licence fees under the Shanks patents over the period from 1996 to 2004 and it received the part of the purchase price of Unipath attributable to the Shanks patents in 2001.\n",
              "Professor Shanks made his application for compensation on 9 June 2006.\n",
              "Professor Shanks contends and, indeed, has always contended that Unilever has had the use of the moneys it derived from the Shanks patents ever since it received them and that this should be taken into account.\n",
              "As Arnold J noted, Professor Shanks did not rely upon this contention before him as a basis for challenging the hearing officers decision as to whether the benefit was outstanding.\n",
              "In my judgement he was right to take that course.\n",
              "The mere passage of time cannot turn a patent which was not an outstanding benefit into one which was.\n",
              "However, he did rely on it to increase the size of the benefit of which he should receive a fair share or, to put it another way, to increase the size of his share if he was successful in overturning the hearing officers decision on the issue of outstanding benefit.\n",
              "That remains the position on this appeal and it is convenient to address it now.\n",
              "The hearing officer rejected Professor Shanks argument on the basis that there was not enough evidence before him to justify an increase.\n",
              "The evidence was in his view too speculative.\n",
              "On appeal, Arnold J held that the time value of the money which Unilever had received was not a benefit derived from the Shanks patents within the meaning of section 41(1).\n",
              "He reasoned that the definition of benefit in section 43(7) coupled with the terms of section 41(1) pointed to the assessment being made as of the date the money was received; that the time value of money was not a benefit Unilever derived from the Shanks patents; that if the time value of money were treated as a relevant benefit the enquiry would have no temporal end; that Professor Shanks could have brought the claim earlier than he did; and that, it being common ground that the Comptroller could not award interest, an award reflecting the time value of money would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme.\n",
              "On further appeal to the Court of Appeal, Patten LJ held, like Arnold J, that the benefit under section 41(1) was limited to direct receipts from the exploitation of the patent rights and did not include any allowance for the fact that the employer had had the benefit of those receipts for a period of time prior to an award under that section.\n",
              "However, Briggs LJ, with whom Sales LJ agreed on this issue, came to the contrary conclusion.\n",
              "He explained, at para 73, that he would expect the time value of money (or its change in real value over time due to inflation) to be relevant in the quantification of the inventors fair share under section 41(1) because of the deleterious effect on the real value of money of the likely substantial time between the employers receipt of the benefit and the making of the order for payment at the end of the proceedings.\n",
              "Mr Alexander, for Unilever, now submits that the approach taken by Patten LJ and Arnold J is the correct one for the reasons they gave and because it is clear, simple and practical, and that the alternative, though theoretically attractive in some respects, would introduce disproportionate complexity, would drive up the costs of proceedings and would actively reward an inventor who delays in bringing a claim, just as Professor Shanks did in this case.\n",
              "In my judgement Mr Alexander was correct to describe the approach contended for by Professor Shanks as attractive, though I would not for my part characterise that attraction as theoretical.\n",
              "To the contrary, it seems to me to be the approach which accords with justice and common sense.\n",
              "Professor Shanks seeks an award which reflects the fact that, on the assumption he prevails on the other limbs of his appeal, he has for many years been kept out of a fair share of the benefit Unilever has derived from the Shanks patents.\n",
              "Nor, with great respect, am I persuaded by the reasoning of Arnold J or that of Patten LJ on appeal.\n",
              "That reasoning has at its heart the proposition that the time value of the money that Unilever has received is neither a benefit nor derived from the Shanks patents.\n",
              "I disagree.\n",
              "I see no reason why the time value of money cannot be a benefit derived from a patent within the meaning of section 41(1).\n",
              "Unilever has had the benefit of the licence fees and other moneys derived from the Shanks patents ever since they were paid.\n",
              "Another legitimate approach, which amounts to the same thing, is that of the majority in the Court of Appeal.\n",
              "On the assumption that he wins on the issue of outstanding benefit, Professor Shanks is entitled to an uplift because the fair share of the benefit should in this case reflect the deleterious effect on the real value of money of the substantial time between Unilevers receipt of the licence fees and other moneys and its making of any payment of compensation.\n",
              "Turning now to Arnold Js other reasons for rejecting this part of Professor Shanks case, the inquiry under section 41(1) will in this case end at the time the order for payment is made.\n",
              "In other cases, in assessing benefit, it may be necessary to look forward.\n",
              "But that is specifically contemplated by section 41(1) which makes clear that, in an appropriate case, an award must be such as to secure for the employee a fair share of the benefit which the employer may reasonably be expected to derive from the patent.\n",
              "I also reject the suggestion that the approach Professor Shanks contends for would cut across the statutory scheme.\n",
              "It is true that the Comptroller has no power to award interest.\n",
              "But that is not what Professor Shanks seeks and in my opinion there is nothing in the scheme which bars the Comptroller from having regard to the impact of inflation in assessing the benefit or what amounts to a fair share of it.\n",
              "As for complexity and delay, there is nothing unduly complex about an assessment of the impact of time on the real value of money; nor should the possibility of an uplift encourage delay, for if in any case the employee has delayed unduly, the Comptroller would no doubt take that into account in carrying out his assessment.\n",
              "In this case there is no finding by the hearing officer that Professor Shanks was unreasonably slow to make his application; nor can he be criticised for his conduct of the proceedings.\n",
              "In my judgement, and on the assumption he is otherwise successful on his appeal, fairness demands that his award of compensation should reflect the detrimental effect of time on the value of money.\n",
              "Was the benefit outstanding?\n",
              "The hearing officer carried out his assessment of the appropriate characterisation of the benefit of the Shanks patents to Unilever by considering that benefit in a number of ways.\n",
              "He looked at it in the light of Unilevers overall profits and turnover, by reference to patents in general, in the context of Unilevers licensing activities, in the light of Unilevers patent activities and finally, as compared to Unilevers activities in general.\n",
              "In the course of this analysis the hearing officer made a series of findings and observations which are to my mind rather striking.\n",
              "He held that there was an extreme disparity in numerical terms between the benefit Unilever received and the regular salary and 100 assignment fee that Professor Shanks was paid.\n",
              "He observed that there was scant evidence before him of Unilevers other licensing activities and that he had been provided with no example of another licensing deal which had provided Unilever with an income at or above the level of the Shanks patents.\n",
              "He found that the Shanks patents had produced a very high rate of return; that Unilever had made a very small effort to commercialise Professor Shanks invention; that Unilevers licensing efforts were serious but not exceptional; and that Unilever had generated the benefit it derived from the Shanks patents at no significant risk.\n",
              "In drawing his conclusions, he held that the benefit was a substantial and significant one in monetary terms, and that in comparison with the benefit to Unilever of other patents, it did stand out.\n",
              "In my opinion all of these matters point strongly to the conclusion that the Shanks patents were an outstanding benefit to CRL having regard to the size and nature of its undertaking as I would hold these features must be understood.\n",
              "How then did the hearing officer arrive at his conclusion that they were not? I think the key aspects of his reasoning may be summarised as follows.\n",
              "Looking first at Unilevers profits and turnover, the hearing officer agreed with Professor Shanks that it was simplistic to look simply at the figures for the overall turnover or profits of the undertaking and to say that a given benefit was only a small percentage of that.\n",
              "He explained that a relatively modest sum might represent an excellent return for a small company but would not do so for a larger entity, such as Unilever, which by its nature, for example being able to contemplate greater expenditure on litigation, could secure a higher return in a negotiation.\n",
              "Ultimately, he continued, it was a matter of considering the benefit in the overall context and making an assessment as to whether it was outstanding.\n",
              "Turning next to the benefit of the Shanks patents in relation to patents in general, the hearing officer explained that there was expert evidence before him on this issue but he found none of it of much assistance.\n",
              "Instead he reasoned that the assessment had to be carried out in the context of the employers undertaking and that he found it hard to see how a benefit of a relatively modest sum of, say, 50,000 could be considered an outstanding benefit in the context of Unilevers overall budget.\n",
              "This was followed by a consideration of the benefit to Unilever of the Shanks patents in the context of its licensing activities.\n",
              "Here the hearing officer recognised that the Shanks patents did stand out in terms of the licensing income they generated but thought that it did not follow that the benefit was outstanding.\n",
              "How the benefit was obtained was, in his view, irrelevant.\n",
              "What mattered was whether the benefit was outstanding in the context of the undertaking as a whole.\n",
              "The hearing officer then considered the benefit to Unilever of the Shanks patents in light of Unilevers broader patent activities.\n",
              "Here he referred to the evidence of Dr Mulder who held the position of Vice President Patents at Unilever.\n",
              "Some years earlier Dr Mulder had attempted to value Unilevers patents but he accepted in the course of his cross examination that his analysis did not produce a value of the patents in monetary terms but rather in terms of the value of product sales to which they related.\n",
              "He was therefore unable to identify any other patent which was more beneficial to Unilever than the Shanks patents.\n",
              "Finally, the hearing officer compared the benefits from the Shanks patents with the benefits generated by its other activities and referred in this connection to the unchallenged evidence of Dr Mulder that Unilever had a number of highly successful products, such as Viennetta ice cream, spreads and deodorants, and that these generated an income of many billions of pounds and many hundreds of millions of pounds of profit over the lifetime of the patents which protected them.\n",
              "He said this gave some indication of the sorts of sums that could be of great benefit to Unilever and they were an order of magnitude greater than the benefit derived from the Shanks patents.\n",
              "The hearing officer expressed his conclusions in these terms: 222.\n",
              "Considering the totality of the evidence, I was left with a clear impression.\n",
              "The benefit provided by the Shanks patents was a substantial and significant one in money terms - the sort of sum that Unilever would, on the evidence, worry about Furthermore, in comparison to the benefit from other patents to Unilever, from the evidence before me it does, in Mr Emanuels words stand out.\n",
              "But Unilever makes profits at an order of magnitude greater on other inventions - albeit primarily by manufacture and at a much lower rate of return than was provided by the Shanks patents.\n",
              "Further, this is not such a case as Kelly, where Floyd J held that without the patents in that case, Amersham would have faced a crisis.\n",
              "There was no suggestion from either party that the Shanks patents were crucial to Unilevers success.\n",
              "223.\n",
              "In my view, taking account of the size and nature of Unilevers business, the benefit provided by the Shanks patents falls short of being outstanding.\n",
              "Did the hearing officer make an error of principle in assessing the benefit?\n",
              "It is apparent from the summary in the immediately foregoing section that a central and essential part of the hearing officers reasoning was that Unilever generated a vast income and commensurate profits from the manufacture and sale of products such as ice cream, spreads and deodorants which had the benefit of patent protection, and that this income and these profits were an order of magnitude greater than the benefits Unilever derived from the Shanks patents.\n",
              "The hearing officer clearly thought that this was highly relevant because he said in terms that it gave an indication of the sorts of benefits generated by highly successful products and so the sorts of sums which could be considered of great benefit to Unilever.\n",
              "This is also apparent from his conclusion, for in referring to profits an order of magnitude greater on other inventions, the hearing officer was referring to the overall profits made by Unilever from the manufacture and sale of these products.\n",
              "There are in my view a number of problems with these aspects of the hearing officers analysis.\n",
              "First, he adopted the wrong starting point.\n",
              "Professor Shanks was employed by CRL, and CRL operated a research facility for the Unilever group.\n",
              "CRLs undertaking for the purposes of section 40 of the 1977 Act was the business of generating inventions and providing those inventions and the patents which protected them to Unilever for use in connection with its business.\n",
              "It was to the size and nature of this undertaking, among other things, that the hearing officer was required by section 40 to have regard in assessing the nature of the benefit to CRL and Unilever of any such patent.\n",
              "Instead the hearing officer took CRLs undertaking to be the whole of the Unilever group and this pervaded the whole of his evaluation.\n",
              "In my judgement that was wrong in principle.\n",
              "Secondly and irrespective of his starting point and the extent of CRLs undertaking, the hearing officers particular focus upon the overall turnover and profits generated by Unilever, as illustrated by the size of its business in making and selling ice cream, spreads and deodorants, was in my view misdirected.\n",
              "The success of these products could no doubt be attributed to a range of factors including quality, branding and pricing.\n",
              "It is also true that they were protected at least to some degree by patent families which related to the processes by which they were made or aspects of the technology which they contained.\n",
              "But, as the hearing officer himself acknowledged, only a proportion of the sale price of any product could be attributed to any patent protection, and Unilevers attempts to assess the value of these other patents failed.\n",
              "Indeed, the hearing officer recognised that, in terms of the benefit which Unilevers patents had generated, the Shanks patents stood out.\n",
              "Thirdly, it cannot be said that the size and success of Unilevers business as a whole played any material part in securing the benefit it has enjoyed from the Shanks patents.\n",
              "That benefit was generated by licensing or selling its patent rights, not by harnessing its manufacturing capacity, its sales and distribution facilities or its goodwill.\n",
              "The licence fees, which constituted the main part of the benefit, were paid by licensees who, with one exception, approached Unilever.\n",
              "It is true that Unilevers licensing personnel negotiated those licences with skill and serious effort but its costs of doing so were modest and taken into account, and the hearing officer made no finding to the effect that the royalty rates were boosted by the application of Unilevers financial muscle or the threat of legal proceedings.\n",
              "These were matters he failed properly to take into account.\n",
              "Fourthly, the hearing officer appeared rightly to disavow an approach which involved assessing the extent and nature of the benefit derived from a patent simply by comparing it to the patent owners overall turnover or profits.\n",
              "But he also indicated these matters might be relevant if, for example, an undertakings size enabled it to exert greater leverage.\n",
              "Yet, having apparently rejected such an approach, he then adopted it.\n",
              "There was no justification here for simply weighing the sums Unilever generated from the Shanks patents against the size of its turnover and overall profitability in products such as Viennetta ice cream, spreads and deodorants and yet this formed an important part of his assessment.\n",
              "I am conscious that the decision of the hearing officer on this issue necessarily involved an evaluation and it is of course well established that an appellate court should be very cautious in differing from such an evaluation unless it involves an error of principle: see, for example, Biogen Inc v Medeva plc [1997] RPC 1, 45 per Lord Hoffmann.\n",
              "That is particularly so where the decision is that of a specialist tribunal.\n",
              "What constitutes an error of principle was considered most recently by Lord Hodge in Actavis Group PTC EHF v ICOS Corpn [2019] UKSC 15; [2019] Bus LR 1318, paras 80-81.\n",
              "As he there explained, such an error is not confined to an error as to the law but extends to certain types of error in the application of a legal standard to the facts in an evaluation of those facts.\n",
              "A legal error might involve asking the wrong question, failing to take into account relevant matters or taking into account irrelevant matters.\n",
              "In the absence of such an error, the appeal court would be justified in differing from a tribunals assessment if it were to reach the view that the tribunals conclusion was outside the bounds within which reasonable disagreement was possible.\n",
              "I am satisfied that, for the reasons given in paras 79-82 above, the hearing officer was wrong in principle and that Arnold J on appeal and the Court of Appeal on further appeal wrongly failed so to hold.\n",
              "Further, having regard to the fundamental nature of these errors, the decision of the hearing officer must be set aside.\n",
              "I have considered whether it is necessary to remit this appeal for a rehearing but I have concluded it is not, for it seems to me to be clear how the hearing officer would or ought to have decided this issue had he directed himself correctly.\n",
              "I would add that this is a conclusion at which I am relieved to arrive in the light of the time these proceedings have taken and the costs that must have been incurred.\n",
              "In summary and as I have foreshadowed, Professor Shanks made his invention using his own initiative for his brief was to work in the area of biosensors for process control and process engineering and he was made to understand that he should not stray too far from it.\n",
              "He built the first prototype of his invention in October 1982, some five months after he had joined CRL.\n",
              "This would have been a new product area for Unilever but it was a development which the group did not, in the hearing officers terminology, get behind and push.\n",
              "It was regarded as far from a key technology and it was one into which Unilever made only a modest investment.\n",
              "It is true that Unilever patented and maintained a patent portfolio which protected it and in due course expended significant effort and skill in the licensing negotiations.\n",
              "But the rewards it enjoyed were substantial and significant, were generated at no significant risk, reflected a very high rate of return, and stood out in comparison with the benefit Unilever derived from other patents.\n",
              "What was more, they could not be attributed to the deployment or application of Unilevers wider business assets or infrastructure; nor were they found to be the consequence of any leverage Unilever could exert because of its size.\n",
              "In short, the benefit Unilever enjoyed from the Shanks patents was outstanding within the meaning of section 40 of the 1977 Act.\n",
              "Fair share\n",
              "Section 41 of the 1977 Act says that an award of compensation to an employee under section 40(1) or (2) shall be such as will secure for the employee a fair share, having regard to all the circumstances, of the benefit which the employer has derived or may be reasonably expected to derive from the patent.\n",
              "Section 41(4) then specifies that various matters must be taken into account.\n",
              "In assessing what would have been a fair share of the benefit Unilever had derived from the Shanks patents, the hearing officer duly addressed each of the matters set out in section 41(4).\n",
              "In so doing he had regard to the nature of Professor Shanks duties and that he was employed to invent; Professor Shanks remuneration, which was commensurate with his level of responsibility; the effort and skill Professor Shanks expended in making the invention; the contribution made by Unilever to the making, developing and working of the invention; and Unilevers licensing effort which, the hearing officer observed, was serious but not exceptional.\n",
              "The hearing officer also had regard to the evidence before him about the percentage award rates in company and university employee compensation schemes.\n",
              "Having regard to all of these matters, the results of a literature review and the parties submissions, he held that 5% would have been the appropriate fair share of the benefit, had it been outstanding.\n",
              "On appeal, Arnold J came to the conclusion that an important factor in Unilevers ability to extract licence fees was the fact that it could afford to bring proceedings for patent infringement and pursue them to a conclusion, and that the hearing officer had wrongly failed to take this into account.\n",
              "In these circumstances he thought that it would not be right to award to Professor Shanks a percentage of the benefit which was higher than the 3% awarded to the inventors in the Kelly case, and that this would have been the fair share of the benefit to award to Professor Shanks, had that benefit been outstanding.\n",
              "On further appeal, the Court of Appeal did not need to address this issue and did not do so.\n",
              "Professor Shanks now contends that Arnold J had no proper basis for reducing the share of the benefit to 3% and that even 5% is too low, for it fails properly to take into account that he conceived the invention outside and in addition to his assigned role; that the licence fees generated by the patent represented an entirely new income stream for Unilever; and that he made the invention and the patent was exploited at no risk to Unilever.\n",
              "He argues that between 10% and 20% of the benefit would represent a fair share.\n",
              "In my judgement Arnold J was wrong to find that 3% represented a fair share of the benefit Unilever enjoyed from the Shanks patents.\n",
              "The hearing officer had well in mind the size of Unilevers business and the nature of the licensing negotiations yet he did not make a finding that it secured the licence rates it did because it could afford to bring and pursue infringement proceedings against the prospective licensees.\n",
              "The absence of such a finding is not at all surprising.\n",
              "Unilever had no manufacturing business it needed to protect and, with one exception, the discussions were initiated by the prospective licensees.\n",
              "In substance, these were negotiations between willing licensors and willing licensees.\n",
              "Arnold J therefore had no basis for reducing the percentage from 5% to 3%.\n",
              "I am not persuaded by Professor Shanks other arguments, however.\n",
              "The hearing officer found that the invention was made in the course of his contractual duties, although its subject matter was not the main focus of his work.\n",
              "Moreover, as the hearing officer also found, Professor Shanks was employed to invent and, in making the invention, did what he was employed to do.\n",
              "I accept that the patent generated a new stream of income for Unilever, but it did not do so without its input.\n",
              "To the contrary, it was brought to fruition by Unilevers negotiation of the licences, and that is something in which Professor Shanks played no part.\n",
              "Finally, it is true that Unilever made only a relatively small effort to commercialise the invention and exploited the Shanks patents at no real risk to itself, but these were matters which the hearing officer took into account in arriving at his figure of 5%.\n",
              "I am satisfied that the hearing officer made no error in the way he approached this issue and it would not be appropriate to interfere with the conclusion to which he came.\n",
              "It only remains to apply to the 5% share of the 24m an uplift to reflect the impact of time on the value of money.\n",
              "Professor Shanks invites us to take 1999 as the median year in which Unilever received the benefit and then to take into account the effect of inflation using the Bank of England calculator.\n",
              "I did not detect any substantive objection from Unilever to this methodology and I think it is a reasonable and fair way to proceed.\n",
              "This produces a figure of about 2m at an average inflation rate of 2.8%.\n",
              "In my judgement the fair share of that benefit to which Professor Shanks is entitled is therefore 2m.\n",
              "Conclusion\n",
              "For these reasons I would allow Professor Shanks appeal.\n",
              "In my judgement the Shanks patents were of outstanding benefit to Unilever and CRL and Professor Shanks is entitled to a fair share of that benefit amounting to 2m.</td>\n",

              "It was not a trading company and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Unilever plc.\n",
              "While employed by CRL, Professor Shanks conceived an invention, the rights to which belonged to CRL from the outset under the Patents Act 1977 (the 1977 Act).\n",
              "CRL assigned those rights to Unilever plc for 100.\n",
              "Unilever was later granted various patents relating to the invention (the Shanks patents).\n",
              "Over time, Unilever derived a net benefit from the Shanks patents of approximately 24.3 million.\n",
              "On 9 June 2006, Professor Shanks applied for compensation under section 40 of the 1977 Act on the basis that the Shanks patents had been of outstanding benefit to CRL and that he was entitled to a fair share of that benefit.\n",
              "On 21 June 2013, the hearing officer acting for the Comptroller General of Patents (the Comptroller) found that, having regard to the size and nature of Unilevers business, the benefit provided by the Shanks patents fell short of being outstanding.\n",
              "Professor Shanks appealed to the High Court and Mr Justice Arnold dismissed the appeal.\n",
              "Professor Shanks then appealed to the Court of Appeal.\n",
              "That appeal succeeded in part, but the Court of Appeal found that Professor Shanks was not entitled to compensation.\n",
              "Professor Shanks now appeals to the Supreme Court.\n",
              "The Supreme Court allows the appeal.\n",
              "Lord Kitchin gives the sole judgment, with which the other Justices agree.\n",
              "An employee who makes an invention which belongs to his or her employer from the outset and for which a patent has been granted is entitled to compensation if he or she establishes: first, that the patent is, having regard among other things to the size and nature of the employers undertaking, of outstanding benefit to the employer; and secondly, that, by reason of these matters, it is just that he or she be awarded compensation [30].\n",
              "At least in the ordinary case, Parliament intended the term employer to mean the inventors actual employer [31].\n",
              "The relevant benefit is the benefit the inventors actual employer has derived or may reasonably be expected to derive from the patent, or from the assignment or grant to a person connected with him of any right in the invention, patent or patent application [32].\n",
              "In assessing the benefit derived or expected to be derived by an employer from an assignment of the patent to a person connected with the employer (the circumstances of this case), the court must consider the position of the actual employer and the benefit which the assignee has in fact gained or is expected to gain [33].\n",
              "Previous cases on applications for inventor compensation are helpful to a point, but they provide no substitute for the statutory test, which requires the benefit to be outstanding.\n",
              "That is an ordinary English word meaning exceptional or such as to stand out and it refers to the benefit (in terms of money or moneys worth) of the patent to the employer rather than the degree of inventiveness of the employee.\n",
              "It is, however, both a relative and qualitative term and the context must be considered [39].\n",
              "An undertaking is a unit or entity which carries on a business activity, and here the undertaking to be considered is that of the company or other entity which employs the inventor [41].\n",
              "The correct approach in identifying the relevant undertaking is to look at the commercial reality of the situation.\n",
              "Where a group company operates a research facility for the benefit of the whole group and the work results in patents which are assigned to other group members for their benefit, the focus of the inquiry into whether any one of those patents is of outstanding benefit to the company must be the extent of the benefit of that patent to the group and how that compares with the benefits derived by the group from other patents for inventions arising from the research carried out by that company [48].\n",
              "A highly material consideration is the extent of the benefit of the Shanks patents to the Unilever group and how that compares with the benefits the group derived from other patents resulting from the work carried out at CRL [51].\n",
              "The court should take into account matters such as the fact that a large undertaking might be able to harness its goodwill and sales force in a way that a smaller undertaking could not do [53].\n",
              "However, a tribunal should be very cautious before accepting a submission that a patent has not been of outstanding benefit to an employer simply because it has had no significant impact on its overall profitability or the value of all of its sales [54].\n",
              "As to the relevance of tax, the employee must account for any tax due on his or her fair share and the employer must account for any tax due on the balance.\n",
              "This approach is consonant with the legislative purpose of the provisions of the 1977 Act and is fairer than an approach which requires the employer to pay the employee a share of the benefit net of tax [58].\n",
              "Separately, if the benefit is outstanding, then the fair share of the benefit should reflect the deleterious effect on the real value of money of the substantial time between Unilevers receipt of the licence fees and other moneys and its making of any payment of compensation [66].\n",
              "The 1977 Act does not bar the Comptroller from having regard to the impact of inflation.\n",

              "This means that she has (in English law) parental responsibility or (in Scots law) parental responsibilities and rights.\n",

              "It also makes it even more important that there be a mechanism for transferring legal parenthood from surrogate to commissioning family.\n",

              "This is not surprising: the deed has been done, the child is here living with the commissioning parents, and his welfare will almost always require that he is not left legally parentless (and possibly also stateless).\n",
              "This has led one academic commentator to remark that: English law, as developed through the jurisprudence of the High Court in the 30 years since [the Warnock Report] does not view commercial surrogacy as an intrinsic wrong (Claire Fenton Glynn, Outsourcing Ethical Dilemmas: Regulating International Surrogacy Arrangements (2016) 24 Med LR 59, 67).\n",

              "These include the requirement that the court treat the welfare of the child as its paramount consideration: the court is required to have regard to the welfare of the child, not only during childhood, but throughout his life.\n",
              "As the Law Commissions comment, although laudable, this creates a tension: welfare considerations will almost always point towards making a parental order but this makes it difficult for the court to police even the requirements of sections 54 and 54A, let alone to enforce any public policy against commercial surrogacy arrangements which might be deduced from the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985.\n",

              "Hence they recommended that the criminal law should ban all agencies, whether profit or non profit making, recruiting surrogates and making surrogacy arrangements; and also ban all professionals from knowingly assisting in the establishment of a surrogate pregnancy; and that surrogacy agreements should be illegal contracts and unenforceable (paras 8.18, 8.19).\n",
              "The minority (Dr Wendy Greengross and Dr David Davies) took the view that the question of exploitation of the surrogate mother, or the treating of her as a means to other peoples ends, is not as clear cut a moral issue as our colleagues suggest (para 3).\n",
              "They agreed that there was no place for commercial surrogacy agencies, as with commercial adoption agencies; but they disagreed with preventing gynaecologists from helping couples to achieve a surrogate pregnancy; they thought that arrangements made by a regulated non profit making body should not be illegal; and that payments made to a surrogate mother should not be a barrier to adoption by the commissioning couple: most surrogate mothers would expect payment for their services (para 7).\n",

              "When the Act was passed, donor insemination had become safer because sperm could be successfully frozen, but IVF and embryo transfer were in their infancy and success rates were very low, and eggs could not be frozen.\n",
              "Public concern about the ethics of these techniques had led to the Warnock committees report, which in turn led to the pioneering work of the HFEA as the first body in the world to regulate such treatments.\n",
              "Since then, new techniques have been developed, success rates have improved, and people who are experiencing problems in conceiving or bearing children, or who are in same sex relationships, increasingly turn to assisted reproduction rather than to adoption in order to fulfil their desire to have a family.\n",
              "While treatment is sometimes available on the NHS, much of it is also provided commercially.\n",
              "It is probable that most gestational surrogacy arrangements in this country involve treatments provided by a clinic licensed by the HFEA.\n",
              "This is required where IVF or embryo transfer are involved.\n",
              "The HFEAs first Code of Practice had one paragraph about surrogacy: this advised that, because either the carrying mother, and in certain circumstances her husband or partner, or the commissioning parents might become the childs legal parents, the welfare of any resulting child should be assessed in relation to both sets of parents, and any risk of disruption to the childs early care and upbringing in the event of a dispute between them considered (para 3.16.a).\n",
              "The most recent, ninth, edition of the Code of Practice, version 2 (2019), has a section on The welfare of the child assessment process for surrogacy arrangements which emphasises the need for a standard operating procedure for centres offering surrogacy treatment (paras 8.9 to 8.13); and a whole chapter (paras 14.1 to 14.14) on surrogacy generally which emphasises the need for full information and discussion about the legal and other implications, as well as counselling, for both the surrogate and the commissioning parents.\n",
              "While this may be off putting for some, and centres are advised to be alive to the vulnerability of all parties, there is no suggestion that such arrangements should be viewed with particular suspicion or discouraged.\n",
              "As to changes in the attitudes of society in general to surrogacy arrangements, the Law Commissions say this (para 1.9): Whilst we acknowledge that there is a lack of public attitudinal research in this area, the research that exists suggests that public attitudes to surrogacy also now stand in stark contrast to the prevailing hostile attitudes at the time of the [Surrogacy Arrangements Act] 1985.\n",
              "The available research reflects the fact that the legislation is now out of step with attitudes towards surrogacy.\n",
              "They cite a YouGov poll in 2014 showing that 59% of adults in Great Britain supported using gestational surrogacy to have children.\n",
              "The Law Commissions paper, Building families through surrogacy: a new law, also includes a full discussion of the empirical evidence about the possible harmful effects of surrogacy on the participants involved and the children and of the ethical arguments about surrogacy (Chapter 2).\n",
              "The latter debate reflects a tension between autonomy and paternalism (para 2.69).\n",
              "The concerns about exploitation and commodification feature most prominently in relation to commercial arrangements.\n",
              "Domestically, those concerns could be alleviated by more effective regulation (para 2.71).\n",
              "Internationally, where the arrangements are almost invariably commercial in nature, it is impossible for UK law to effect change, except in situations involving intended parents who will bring the child back to the UK (para 2.72): In that respect, we make a provisional proposal for reform that would enable legal parenthood granted overseas to be recognised in the UK, only after an appraisal of the law and practice of surrogacy in each country.\n",
              "We hope that such a development would encourage UK intended parents who do look for an international surrogacy arrangement to use countries where there is a level of confidence in the protection provided to women who become surrogates.\n",
              "The reality is that there is a spectrum of surrogacy arrangements.\n",
              "At one end of the scale there are desperately poor women who are induced to sell one of the few things they have for sale, their wombs, and are often grossly exploited by the agents and middlemen who make serious profits from the large sums which desperate commissioning parents are prepared to pay.\n",
              "At the other end of the scale are altruistic women who enjoy being pregnant and are happy to make a gift of their child bearing capacity to people who need it.\n",
              "It is no longer thought that women should not have the right to choose to use their bodies in this way.\n",
              "But it is thought that both they and the commissioning parents should be protected from exploitation and abuse.\n",
              "It is also thought that surrogacy arrangements, whether altruistic or commercial, should guard against any possibility that children are being bought and sold: see the Report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children, including child prostitution, child pornography and other child sexual abuse material (A/HRC/37/60, 15 January 2018).\n",
              "Application to this case\n",
              "This case is about the assessment of reasonable damages to compensate a woman who has been wrongly deprived of the ability to bear her own children.\n",
              "With the greatest of respect to the argument on behalf of the claimant, accepted by the Court of Appeal, it is not about the illegality defence and the new framework adopted in Patel v Mirza [2017] AC 467.\n",
              "Nor is it to be likened to a case like Gray v Thames Trains Ltd [2009] UKHL 33; [2009] 1 AC 1339, where the injury suffered by the claimant led to his committing a serious criminal offence and suffering the consequences of doing so, for which he claimed but was denied compensation.\n",
              "Nothing which the claimant proposes to do involves a criminal offence either here or abroad.\n",
              "Her preferred solution is a Californian surrogacy which is lawful there and UK law does not prohibit her from arranging or taking part in it.\n",
              "Her second best solution would be lawful surrogacy arrangements here.\n",
              "The general principle upon which damages in tort are assessed was stated by Lord Blackburn in Livingstone v Rawyards Coal Co (1880) 5 App Cas 25, 39: I do not think there is any difference of opinion as to its being a general rule that, where any injury is to be compensated by damages, in settling the sum of money to be given for reparation of damages you should as nearly as possible get at that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured, or who has suffered, in the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation.\n",
              "There are qualifications to that principle, of course.\n",
              "The first is that some heads of damages which would readily fall within that principle are nevertheless irrecoverable because to allow this would be contrary to legal or public policy.\n",
              "A well known example is McFarlane v Tayside Health Board [2000] 2 AC 59.\n",
              "The Inner House of the Court of Session held that a couple who had a child after the husband had had a vasectomy, allegedly because of negligent advice, could claim damages, not only for the pregnancy and birth, but also for the cost of bringing up the child they never meant to have.\n",
              "The House of Lords held that they could not claim the costs of bringing up a healthy child.\n",
              "They gave a variety of reasons for this, but they all amount to a policy against awarding what would be the normal measure of the claimants loss.\n",
              "A second qualification is that, in seeking to restore what has been lost, the steps taken must be reasonable ones and the costs thereby incurred must be reasonable.\n",
              "The first question, therefore, is whether it is ever possible to claim damages for the cost of surrogacy arrangements, even where these are made on a lawful basis in this country and using the claimants own eggs.\n",
              "It might once have been possible to argue that the law should not facilitate the bringing into the world of children who would otherwise never have been born.\n",
              "But the acceptance and widespread use of assisted reproduction techniques, for which damages are payable, means that this is no longer possible.\n",
              "In Briody, I did not consider that an arrangement which conformed to English law would be contrary to public policy.\n",
              "The question was whether it was reasonable to seek to remedy the loss of a womb through surrogacy (para 30).\n",
              "This would depend upon the chances of a successful outcome.\n",
              "In that case they were vanishingly small.\n",
              "Nevertheless, had they been better, I expressed the tentative view that it would be a step too far.\n",
              "But I recognised the force of the contrary argument that, given the right evidence of the reasonableness of the procedure and the prospects of success, it should be capable of attracting an award (para 32).\n",
              "Sir Robert Nelson found it difficult to see why, on general principle, where the prospects of success are reasonable, if not good, and the claimant had delayed her cancer treatment to ensure that her eggs were harvested, the claim should not succeed (para 49).\n",
              "McCombe LJ agreed (para 84).\n",
              "So do I.\n",
              "The next question is whether it is possible to claim damages for UK surrogacy arrangements using donor eggs.\n",
              "In Briody, I expressed the view that this was not truly restorative of what the claimant had lost.\n",
              "It was seeking to make up for what she had lost by giving her something different (para 25).\n",
              "We need not concern ourselves with whether or not this view was technically obiter.\n",
              "In my view it was probably wrong then and is certainly wrong now.\n",
              "It was argued for the claimant that this is no different from other artificial\n",
              "means of replacing what has been lost, for example, by having an artificial limb fitted to replace the one which has been amputated.\n",
              "It is not ones own genetic material and it is not as good as a real limb, but it is the closest one can get to putting the claimant in the position she would have been in had she not been injured.\n",
              "Of course, the analogy is not exact, because the claimant is not being supplied with a replacement womb.\n",
              "But in many ways that is indeed what she is being supplied with, albeit temporarily, through the generosity of a surrogate mother who offers the use of her own womb.\n",
              "Not only that, as counsel had argued for Mrs Briody, a woman can hope for four things from having a child: the experience of carrying and giving birth to a child; the perpetuation of ones own genes; the perpetuation of ones partners genes; and the pleasure of bringing up a child as ones own (para 24).\n",
              "Donor egg surrogacy using a partners sperm gives her two of those.\n",
              "And for many women, the pleasure of bringing up children as ones own is far and away the most important benefit of having children.\n",
              "If this is the best that can be achieved to make good what she has lost, why should she be denied it?\n",
              "This view is reinforced by the dramatic changes in the idea of what constitutes a family which have taken place in recent decades, referred to earlier.\n",
              "There are many different kinds of family these days.\n",
              "As King LJ pointed out in the Court of Appeal, psychologically and emotionally the baby who is born is just as much their child as if one of them had carried and given birth to him or her (para 103).\n",
              "This is the experience of those judges who have the happy experience of granting parental orders.\n",
              "I would therefore hold that, subject to reasonable prospects of success, damages can be claimed for the reasonable costs of UK surrogacy using donor eggs.\n",
              "That leaves only the most difficult question: what about the costs of foreign commercial surrogacy? Surrogacy contracts are unenforceable here.\n",
              "It is well established that the UK courts will not enforce a foreign contract which would be contrary to public policy in the UK: see Rousillon v Rousillon (1880) 14 Ch D 351; Israel Discount Bank of New York v Hadjipateras [1984] 1 WLR 137.\n",
              "Why then should the UK courts facilitate the payment of fees under such contracts by making an award of damages to reflect them?\n",
              "In this case, we have the advantage of evidence about the comparative costs of UK and Californian surrogacy.\n",
              "One thing becomes clear.\n",
              "Many of the items in the Californian bill would also be claimable if the surrogacy took place here.\n",
              "The costs of the fertility treatment and egg donation itself, although they are higher in the US than here, would be recoverable for a UK surrogacy.\n",
              "Then there is the cost of the payment to the surrogate mother herself, which is higher than the reasonable expenses thought acceptable here.\n",
              "But, as we have seen, it is not unlawful for commissioning parents to make such payments here.\n",
              "And whether made here or abroad they are likely to be retrospectively authorised by the court.\n",
              "Then there are the fees paid to the UK lawyers, which would also be recoverable here, if reasonable.\n",
              "They are very much higher for a US than for a UK surrogacy, presumably because there is so much more work to be done, but we must also presume that such work does not fall foul of the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985.\n",
              "That leaves the fees paid to the US lawyers and surrogacy agency, which would be unlawful here but are not in the US.\n",
              "To what extent should that taint all of the items in the bill?\n",
              "The damages would be awarded to the claimant, the commissioning parent.\n",
              "It is not against the law in this country for a commissioning parent to do any of the acts which are prohibited by section 2(1) of the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985 (see section 2(2)(b)).\n",
              "Nor is it against the law in this country for an intending surrogate to do so (see section 2(2)(a)).\n",
              "That is true even of activities in this country, let alone in another country.\n",
              "It has never been the object of the legislation to criminalise the surrogate or commissioning parents.\n",
              "The only deterrent is the risk that the court hearing an application for a parental order might refuse retrospectively to authorise the payments.\n",
              "As we have seen, there is no evidence that that has ever been done.\n",
              "The courts paramount consideration is the welfare of the child involved, which will almost certainly be best served by cementing his home and his family links with the commissioning parents.\n",
              "Added to that are all the other developments which have taken place since the decision in Briody.\n",
              "The courts have bent over backwards to recognise the relationships created by surrogacy, including foreign commercial surrogacy.\n",
              "The government now supports surrogacy as a valid way of creating family relationships, although there are no plans to allow commercial surrogacy agencies to operate here.\n",
              "The use of assisted reproduction techniques is now widespread and socially acceptable.\n",
              "The Law Commissions have provisionally proposed a new pathway for surrogacy which, if accepted, would enable the child to be recognised as the child of the commissioning parents from birth, thus bringing the law closer to the Californian model, but with greater safeguards.\n",
              "While the risks of exploitation and commodification are heightened in commercial surrogacy, they are not thought an insuperable ethical barrier to properly regulated arrangements.\n",
              "For all those reasons, I conclude that it is no longer contrary to public policy to award damages for the costs of a foreign commercial surrogacy.\n",
              "However, that does not mean that such damages, still less damages such as are claimed in this case, will always be awarded.\n",
              "There are some important limiting factors.\n",
              "First, the proposed programme of treatments must be reasonable.\n",
              "There may be good reasons to think that, but for the negligence, the claimant would have had the number of children now proposed, but there may not.\n",
              "Second, it must be reasonable for the claimant to seek the foreign commercial arrangements proposed rather than to make arrangements within the UK.\n",
              "This is unlikely to be reasonable unless the foreign country has a well established system in which the interests of all involved, the surrogate, the commissioning parents and any resulting child, are properly safeguarded.\n",
              "Unregulated systems where both surrogate and commissioning parents are at the mercy of unscrupulous agents and providers and children may be bought and sold should not be funded by awards of damages in the UK.\n",
              "This has not been explored in this case, but it should not be concluded that, even in California, all is always well (as the Report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur shows).\n",
              "Third, the costs involved must be reasonable.\n",
              "This too has not been put in issue in this case, which has been argued as a matter of principle, but it should certainly not be taken for granted that a court would always sanction the sorts of sums of money which have been claimed here.\n",
              "With those caveats, therefore, I would dismiss this appeal.\n",
              "LORD CARNWATH: (dissenting) (with whom Lord Reed agrees)\n",
              "I am grateful for Lady Hales full exposition of the facts, and of the legislative and policy background.\n",
              "This enables me to deal with the remaining issues between us relatively briefly, without in any way diminishing the impact of these tragic events on the claimant, or the seriousness of the legal issues to which they give rise.\n",
              "On the first two issues identified by Lady Hale (para 8), I agree with her reasoning and conclusions.\n",
              "I differ only on the last issue: damages to fund the cost of commercial surrogacy arrangements in a country (in this case California) where this is not unlawful.\n",
              "As I think Lady Hale accepts, her conclusion on that issue is a departure from the clear, indeed emphatic, position on this issue, expressed in 2001 in her leading judgment in Briody v St Helens and Knowsley Area Health Authority [2001] EWCA Civ 1010; [2002] QB 856.\n",
              "It is important to note that in Briody there was a difference between the claimants case as presented to the judge, and as sought to be advanced in the Court of Appeal.\n",
              "Before the judge it was based solely on a proposed commercial surrogacy agreement in California (para 4).\n",
              "Before the Court of Appeal, as Lady Hale noted (para 9), the claimant had abandoned the Californian agreement and sought leave to adduce evidence of a proposed surrogacy arrangement through the self help group, COTS (Childlessness Overcome Through Surrogacy), governed by English law.\n",
              "Having observed that English law on surrogacy is quite clear, that the activities of commercial surrogacy agencies are unlawful, and that it is an offence for any person to take part in negotiating surrogacy arrangements on a commercial basis (para 10), and having reviewed the varying practice round the world, she had no difficulty in agreeing with the judge that the proposals put to her were contrary to the public policy of this country, clearly established in legislation, and that it would be quite unreasonable to expect a defendant to fund it. (para 15) By contrast, she found it impossible to say that the claimants new proposals were contrary to public policy in that sense (para 16).\n",
              "The remainder of the judgment is devoted largely to that aspect.\n",
              "We are not of course bound by that decision even as respects commercial surrogacy.\n",
              "But I do not understand it to have been seriously questioned as a reflection of the law and policy as it stood at the time.\n",
              "However, in her present judgment, Lady Hale has described the dramatic developments in law and social attitudes (para 28ff) which lead her to conclude ultimately that it is no longer contrary to public policy to award such damages (para 53).\n",
              "I agree with her (para 40) that the resolution of this issue is not assisted by reference to recent judgments of this court on the scope of the illegality defence (such as Patel v Mirza [2016] UKSC 42; [2017] AC 467).\n",
              "A commercial surrogacy arrangement, such as is proposed, is not in itself unlawful in the country in which it would take place.\n",
              "Nor is the claimants participation in such an arrangement from this country.\n",
              "For that reason I agree that the case cannot be likened directly to a case like Gray v Thames Trains Ltd [2009] UKHL 33; [2009] AC 1339, which involved a serious criminal offence by the claimant.\n",
              "However that is not the end of the enquiry.\n",
              "As Lady Hale recognises (para 42), there is a further question of legal or public policy perhaps best exemplified by McFarlane v Tayside Health Board [2000] 2 AC 59.\n",
              "It is not easy to extract a single ratio to support the conclusion in that case that the damages could not extend to the cost of bringing up a healthy but unwanted child.\n",
              "However further light was cast by the speeches in Rees v Darlington Memorial Hospital NHS Trust [2003] UKHL 52; [2004] 1 AC 309, in which the House had to consider the application of the McFarlane principles to the birth of an unwanted child to a mother with a severe visual handicap.\n",
              "Lord Bingham (para 6) spoke of the different approaches and different reasons adopted by the members of the House in McFarlane but thought it clear that all of them were moved to adopt it for reasons of policy (legal, not public, policy).\n",
              "He explained: The policy considerations underpinning the judgments of the House were, as I read them, an unwillingness to regard a child (even if unwanted) as a financial liability and nothing else, a recognition that the rewards which parenthood (even if involuntary) may or may not bring cannot be quantified and a sense that to award potentially very large sums of damages to the parents of a normal and healthy child against a National Health Service always in need of funds to meet pressing demands would rightly offend the communitys sense of how public resources should be allocated.\n",
              "Kirby J was surely right to suggest in Cattanach v Melchior [2003] HCA 38, para 178) that: Concern to protect the viability of the National Health Service at a time of multiple demands upon it might indeed help to explain the invocation in the House of Lords in McFarlane of the notion of distributive justice.\n",
              "To similar effect Lord Steyn said (para 29): The House did not rest its decision on public policy in a conventional sense Instead the Law Lords relied on legal policy.\n",
              "In considering this question the House was bound, in the circumstances of the case, to consider what in their view the ordinary citizen would regard as morally acceptable.\n",
              "Invoking the moral theory of distributive justice, and the requirements of being just, fair and reasonable, culled from case law, are in context simply routes to establishing the legal policy.\n",
              "Lord Millett also spoke of legal policy (para 105): In their speeches [in McFarlane] the individual members of the Appellate Committee all based this conclusion on legal policy, though they expressed themselves in different terms.\n",
              "My noble and learned friend, Lord Steyn, spoke of distributive justice; he asked himself what would be morally acceptable to the ordinary person.\n",
              "Others spoke of what was fair, just and reasonable which expresses the same idea.\n",
              "I spoke openly of legal policy.\n",
              "I said, at p 108: The admission of a novel head of damages is not solely a question of principle.\n",
              "Limitations on the scope of legal liability arise from legal policy, which is to say our more or less inadequately expressed ideas of what justice demands (see Prosser & Keeton on Torts, 5th ed (1984), p 264).\n",
              "This is the case whether the question concerns the admission of a new head of damages or the admission of a duty of care in a new situation.\n",
              "Legal policy in this sense is not the same as public policy, even though moral considerations may play a part in both.\n",
              "The court is engaged in a search for justice, and this demands that the dispute be resolved in a way which is fair and reasonable and accords with ordinary notions of what is fit and proper.\n",
              "It is also concerned to maintain the coherence of the law and the avoidance of inappropriate distinctions if injustice is to be avoided in other cases.\n",
              "Others too made it clear that this was not the same as public policy in the traditional sense of that expression.\n",
              "It would not have been contrary to public policy to award damages to the pursuers in McFarlane any more than it would be contrary to public policy to award damages for breach of contract beyond the limits imposed by the rule in Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch 341.\n",
              "But in both cases the denial of damages rests upon policy considerations.\n",
              "It seems clear therefore that the issue is seen as one of legal policy, to be determined by the courts.\n",
              "It is more difficult to identify the criteria which the court is to use for that purpose.\n",
              "In the present context I find most helpful Lord Milletts emphasis on maintaining the coherence of the law.\n",
              "In that respect the present case seems to me easier than either McFarlane or Rees.\n",
              "It is difficult to think of a better guide to where to draw the line in a highly sensitive area such as this than that indicated by Parliament.\n",
              "Although this case is not concerned with illegality as such, the underlying principle of coherence or consistency in the law is of broader application.\n",
              "Although, as noted above, Gray v Thames Trains Ltd is not directly relevant, the speeches of Lord Hoffmann and Lord Rodger contain a valuable discussion of the underlying principle.\n",
              "The same idea is echoed in some of the judgments in Patel v Mirza (see para 155 per Lord Neuberger; para 191 per Lord Mance: the law must aspire to be a unified institution, the parts of which contract, tort, the criminal law must be in essential harmony quoting McLachlin J in Hall v Hebert [1993] 2 SCR 15, 175 176).\n",
              "Lord Rodger, in particular, referred in Gray to the desirability of different organs of the same legal system adopting a consistent approach to the same events (para 76).\n",
              "He continued: 77.\n",
              "In British Columbia v Zastowny [2008] 1 SCR 27, 38, para 23, Rothstein J treated the need to preserve the integrity of the justice system, by preventing inconsistency in the law, as a matter of judicial policy that underlay the ex turpi causa doctrine.\n",
              "In other words, in the circumstances of that case the application of the ex turpi causa doctrine helped to promote the more fundamental legal policy of preventing inconsistency in the law.\n",
              "That such a policy exists is beyond question.\n",
              "In Zastowny and the preceding cases, the need was to ensure that the civil and criminal courts were consistent in their handling of the plaintiffs criminal conduct and its consequences.\n",
              "But that is simply one manifestation of a desirable attribute of any developed legal system.\n",
              "In classical Roman law the jurists were at pains to ensure that the various civil law and praetorian remedies worked together in harmony in relation to the same facts.\n",
              "One of the hallmarks of a good modern code is that its provisions should interrelate and interact so as to achieve a consistent application of its overall policy objectives.\n",
              "Complete harmony may well be harder to achieve in an uncodified system hence the constant attention paid by the classical jurists to the problem since different remedies will have developed at different times and in response to particular demands.\n",
              "But the gradual drawing together of law and equity in English law illustrates the same pursuit of harmony and consistency.\n",
              "And, certainly, the courts are conscious that inconsistencies should be avoided where possible.\n",
              "So, for instance, a court should not award damages in tort if a contractual claim based on the same events would be excluded by some term in the contract between the parties.\n",
              "Similarly, a court should not give a remedy on the ground of unjust enrichment if this would be tantamount to enforcing a contract which the law would treat as void in the circumstances.\n",
              "Likewise, in the present case, when considering the claim for loss of earnings, a civil court should bear in mind that it is desirable for the criminal and civil courts to be consistent in the way that they regard what the claimant did.\n",
              "As Samuels JA observed in State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Wiegold [(1991)] 25 NSWLR 500, 514, failure to do so would generate the sort of clash between civil and criminal law that is apt to bring the law into disrepute.\n",
              "As that passage makes clear, the objective is consistency or coherence between the civil and criminal law within a particular system of law.\n",
              "The fact that the laws of other jurisdictions and other systems may reflect different policy choices seems to me beside the point.\n",
              "It would in my view be contrary to that principle for the civil courts to award damages on the basis of conduct which, if undertaken in this country, would offend its criminal law.\n",
              "It is true that there have been striking developments in societys approach to\n",
              "many issues affecting family life, including surrogacy, as the Law Commissions comprehensive report demonstrates.\n",
              "There has however been no change to the critical laws affecting commercial surrogacy, which led to the refusal in 2001 of damages on that basis.\n",
              "Nor does the Law Commission propose any material change in that respect.\n",
              "It is also apparent from recent studies that public attitudes remain deeply divided (see for example the Second Report of the Surrogacy UK Working Group on Surrogacy Law Reform (December 2018).\n",
              "So long as that remains the state of the law on commercial surrogacy in this court, it would not in my view be consistent with legal coherence for the courts to allow damages to be awarded on a different basis.\n",
              "In short, I consider that the decision of the Court of Appeal was correct in 2001, and remains correct today.\n",

              "Before having the treatment, she had eight eggs collected and frozen.\n",
              "The focus of this appeal is on the damages payable for the loss of the ability to bear her own child.\n",
              "She and her partner wanted to have four children.\n",
              "It was probable that, through surrogacy arrangements, they could have two children using her eggs and his sperm.\n",
              "They then wished to have two more children using donor eggs and his sperm.\n",
              "Her preference was for surrogacy arrangements in California on a commercial basis.\n",
              "If this was not funded, she intended to use non commercial arrangements in the UK.\n",
              "The hospital admitted liability.\n",
              "Assessing damages, the judge held in relation to surrogacy that, following Briody v St Helens & Knowsley Area Health Authority [2000] EWCA Civ 1010; [2002] QB 856 (Briody), he was bound to reject the claim for commercial surrogacy in California as contrary to public policy, and to hold that surrogacy using donor eggs was not restorative of the claimants fertility.\n",
              "By contrast, damages could be awarded for two own egg surrogacies in the UK.\n",
              "The claimant appealed against the denial of her claim for commercial surrogacy and the use of donor eggs.\n",
              "The hospital cross appealed against the award for the two own egg surrogacies.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal dismissed the cross appeal and allowed the appeal on both points.\n",
              "The hospital now appeals to the Supreme Court.\n",
              "The appeal raises three issues.\n",
              "First, can damages to fund surrogacy arrangements using the claimants own eggs be recovered? Second, if so, can damages to fund arrangements using donor eggs be recovered? Third, in either event, can damages to fund the cost of commercial surrogacy arrangements in a country where this is not unlawful be recovered?\n",
              "By a majority, the Supreme Court dismisses the appeal.\n",
              "Lady Hale gives the majority judgment, with which Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson agree.\n",
              "Lord Carnwath gives a judgment dissenting on issue three, with which Lord Reed agrees.\n",
              "Lady Hales judgment explains that under UK law, in essence, surrogacy arrangements are completely unenforceable; the surrogate mother is always the childs legal parent unless and until a court makes a parental order transferring legal parenthood to the commissioning parents; and the making of surrogacy arrangements on a commercial basis is banned.\n",
              "The details are more complicated [9].\n",
              "For example, section 2(1) of the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985 (the 1985 Act) bans third parties from (among other things) initiating or taking part in negotiations with a view to making surrogacy arrangements on a commercial basis.\n",
              "However, offences under the 1985 Act can only be committed in the UK, and so there is nothing to stop agencies based abroad from making surrogacy arrangements on a commercial basis abroad.\n",
              "Nor does this ban extend to acts by commissioning parents or surrogate mothers [19 21].\n",
              "As for Briody, it is not binding on the court, and its persuasiveness is affected by subsequent developments in the law and social attitudes relating to surrogacy (see below) [29 39].\n",
              "Nothing which the claimant proposes to do involves a criminal offence here or abroad.\n",
              "Damages in tort seek to put the injured party in the position she would have been in had she not been injured; but they cannot be recovered where it would be contrary to legal or public policy, or unreasonable [40 43].\n",
              "On the first issue in the appeal, Briody did not rule out the award of damages for own egg surrogacy arrangements made in the UK; rather, it held that whether it was reasonable to seek to remedy the loss of a womb through surrogacy depended on the chances of a successful outcome.\n",
              "Here, those chances are reasonable, and the claimant delayed cancer treatment to ensure that her eggs were harvested.\n",
              "It is therefore difficult to see why the claim should not succeed [44].\n",
              "On the second issue, the view expressed in Briody, that damages for donor egg surrogacy arrangements could not be recovered as they were not restorative of what the claimant had lost, was probably wrong then, and is certainly wrong now.\n",
              "There have been dramatic developments in the laws idea of what constitutes a family [30].\n",
              "And this is the closest one can get to putting the claimant in the position she would have been in had she not been injured.\n",
              "Therefore, as long as the arrangement has reasonable prospects of success, damages for the reasonable costs of it may be awarded [45 48].\n",
              "On the third issue, UK courts will not enforce a foreign contract if it would be contrary to public policy.\n",
              "But most items in the bill for a surrogacy in California could also be claimed if it occurred here.\n",
              "In addition, damages would be awarded to the claimant, the commissioning parent, and it is not against UK law for such a person to do the acts prohibited by section 2(1) of the 1985 Act.\n",
              "Added to that are developments since Briody: the courts have striven to recognise the relationships created by surrogacy; government policy now supports it; assisted reproduction has become widespread and socially acceptable; and the Law Commissions have proposed a surrogacy pathway which, if accepted, would enable the child to be recognised as the commissioning parents child from birth.\n",
              "Awards of damages for foreign commercial surrogacy are therefore no longer contrary to public policy.\n",
              "However, there are important factors limiting the availability and extent of such awards: both the treatment programme and the costs involved must be reasonable; and it must be reasonable for the claimant to seek the foreign commercial arrangements proposed rather than to make arrangements within the UK; this is unlikely to be reasonable unless the foreign country has a well established system in which the interests of all involved, including the child, are properly safeguarded [49 54].\n",
              "Lord Carnwaths dissenting judgment differs from the majority on the third issue only.\n",
              "In his view, while this case is not concerned with illegality, there is a broader principle of legal coherence, which aims to preserve consistency between civil and criminal law.\n",
              "It would go against that principle for civil courts to award damages based on conduct which, if undertaken in the UK, would offend its criminal law.\n",
              "Societys approach to surrogacy has developed, but there has been no change in the critical laws on commercial surrogacy which led to the refusal in Briody of damages on that basis.\n",

              "Like Mitting J, Hooper LJ concluded that the clear meaning of the relevant provisions was that a civil recovery order could be made in respect of property wherever in the world the property was located, and there was no reason not to give effect to the natural meaning of the language.\n",
              "Like Mitting J, Hooper LJ concluded that section 286 made an exception in the case of an order made in Scotland.\n",
              "Hooper LJ derived support for his conclusions from analogies with the law of bankruptcy and from the practice of issuing worldwide freezing orders.\n",

              "A summary of my conclusions\n",
              "Because of the complexity of the subject matter of this appeal I propose to follow the example of Hooper LJ by summarising my conclusions at the outset. (i) The courts below placed undue weight on the definition of property in POCA. (ii) The appellants have placed undue weight on the presumption that a statute does not have extraterritorial effect. (iii) States have, by agreement, departed from the customary principles of international law in the case of confiscating the proceeds of crime.\n",
              "Of particular relevance is the 1990 Strasbourg Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime (the Strasbourg Convention).\n",
              "POCA must be read in the light of that Convention. (iv) The Convention recognises that the courts of state A may make an order purporting to vest in the authorities of state A property that is situated in state B in circumstances where the property is the proceeds of the criminal conduct of a defendant subject to the criminal jurisdiction of state A. (v) The Convention provides that effect should be given to such an order by confiscation proceedings in state B at the request of state A. (vi) The answer to the issue raised by the PFO appeal depends upon an analysis of both the scheme and the language of POCA considered in the light of the Convention. (vii) Parts 2, 3 and 4 of POCA provide for (a) the imposition in personam of obligations in respect of property worldwide; (b) measures in rem to secure and realise property within the United Kingdom; and (c) requests to be made to other states to take such measures in respect of property within their territories. (viii) Part 5 of POCA makes provision for in rem proceedings in respect of property within the United Kingdom but not outside it. (ix) The scheme of POCA, as described above, accords with arrangements made by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Requests and Orders) Order 2005 (SI 2005/3181) (the Order) for giving effect to requests from other states in relation to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime. (x) The scheme of POCA as described above also accords with the requirements of a coherent international scheme for confiscation of the proceeds of crime and with principles of public international law.\n",
              "The converse is the case if SOCAs submissions as to the extraterritorial effect of Part 5 are correct. (xi) Section 286 is an anomalous enigma and cannot justify giving the provisions of POCA that relate to the rest of the United Kingdom a meaning different from that which they would bear in the absence of section 286. (xii) For all these reasons the PFO appeal should be allowed.\n",
              "The definition\n",
              "Part 5 of POCA places on the High Court in England and Wales and Northern Ireland and the Court of Session in Scotland the obligation, in prescribed circumstances, to make a civil recovery order in respect of property which is, or represents, property obtained through unlawful conduct.\n",
              "Section 316(4) has a definition of property (the definition) that applies in Part 5: Property is all property wherever situated and includes (i) money, (ii) all forms of property, real or personal, heritable or moveable, (c) incorporeal property. things in action and other intangible or Mitting J and the Court of Appeal were impressed by the natural meaning of the words wherever situated and concluded that these words should be applied, without restriction, to property in respect of which a recovery order could be made.\n",
              "Thus a recovery order could be made in respect of any form of property, whether real, personal or a chose in action, and wherever in the world that property was situated.\n",
              "The words wherever situated do not describe the type of property to which Part 5 applies.\n",
              "Rather they indicate the location of the property to which the provisions of Part 5 can apply.\n",
              "The definition is repeated no less than eight times in POCA sections 84(1), 150(1), 232(1), 316(4), 326(9), 340(9), 414(1) and 447(4).\n",
              "POCA is peppered with references to property.\n",
              "All fall within the definition.\n",
              "But the definition cannot be applied so as to add to the words property, wherever it appears, the words wherever situated.\n",
              "As I shall demonstrate, most of the provisions of POCA apply only to property within England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.\n",
              "By way simply of example, I can refer to section 45(1) which confers on a constable the power to seize property to prevent its removal from England and Wales.\n",
              "Some provisions refer, however, to property worldwide.\n",
              "Whether or not the location of property to which a provision of POCA refers is subject to a territorial restriction depends upon the context.\n",
              "I so held, when giving the only reasoned speech, in King v Director of the Serious Fraud Office [2008] UKHL 17; [2009] 1 WLR 718, para 37.\n",
              "For these reasons I do not attach to the words in the definition wherever situated the weight that they have carried with the courts below.\n",
              "In order to decide on the scope of the application of Part 5 of POCA it is necessary to consider both the structure and the language of the Act having regard to relevant principles of international law.\n",

              "Mr Jones QC for the appellants submitted that it was a breach of international law for a United Kingdom statute even to purport to vest in a United Kingdom authority property situated in the territory of another state.\n",
              "Mitting J began his judgment by reference to the presumption of statutory interpretation that a statute will not have extraterritorial effect and to the statement of Lord Hoffmann in Socit Eram Shipping Co Ltd v Cie Internationale de Navigation [2003] UKHL 30; [2004] 1 AC 260, para 54: it is a general principle of international law that one sovereign state should not trespass upon the authority of another, by attempting to seize assets situated within the jurisdiction of the foreign state or compelling its citizens to do acts within its boundaries.\n",
              "Hooper LJ himself cited the statement of Lord Diplock in R v Cuthbertson [1981] AC 470, 485: Under English rules of conflict of laws it is in my view well established that an English court has no jurisdiction either in a criminal or a civil matter to make orders purporting ipso jure to transfer moveable property situate abroad.\n",

              "It provides: 1.\n",
              "The Parties shall co operate with each other to the widest extent possible for the purposes of investigations and proceedings aiming at the confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds. 2.\n",
              "Each Party shall adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to enable it to comply, under the conditions provided for in this chapter, with requests: a. for confiscation of specific items of property representing proceeds or instrumentalities, as well as for confiscation of proceeds consisting in a requirement to pay a sum of money corresponding to the value of proceeds; b. for investigative assistance and provisional measures with a view to either form of confiscation referred to under a. above.\n",
              "The Explanatory Report submitted to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe by the committee of experts who drew up the Convention, illuminates article 7: 10.\n",
              "Where the law enforcement agencies and judicial authorities have gathered information through investigations, there should also be efficient means available to ensure that the offender does not remove the instruments and proceeds of his criminal activities.\n",
              "Freezing of bank accounts, seizure of property or other measures of conservancy need to be taken to ensure this.\n",
              "Section 3 of Chapter III provides for international co operation in respect of provisional measures.\n",
              "In order to secure the confiscation of the instruments and proceeds from crime, the Convention provides in section 4 of Chapter III principally two forms of international co operation, namely the execution by the requested State of a confiscation order made abroad and, secondly, the institution, under its own law, of national proceedings leading to a confiscation by the requested State at the request of another State.\n",
              "In respect of the first alternative, the Convention follows the pattern of the European Convention on the International Validity of Criminal Judgments.\n",

              "Where a party has instituted criminal proceedings or proceedings for the purpose of confiscation and so requests, another party must take provisional measures such as freezing or seizing to secure property which may become subject to confiscation, in so far as permitted by its domestic legislation.\n",

              "There was an issue in the Court of Appeal as to whether the Strasbourg Convention applied to Part 5 proceedings.\n",
              "Hooper LJ held at para 72 that it did.\n",
              "I agree with him.\n",
              "The Explanatory Report makes the following comment at para 15: The experts were also able to identify considerable differences in respect of the procedural organisation of the taking of decisions to confiscate (decisions taken by criminal courts, administrative courts, separate judicial authorities, in civil or criminal proceedings totally separate from those in which the guilt of the offender is determined (these proceedings are referred to in the text of the Convention as proceedings for the purpose of confiscation and in the explanatory report sometimes as in rem proceedings), etc).\n",
              "It was also possible to distinguish differences in respect of the procedural framework of such decisions (presumptions of licitly/illicitly acquired property, time limits, etc).\n",
              "The experts agreed that it would be impossible to devise an efficient instrument of international co operation without taking into account these basic differences in national legislation.\n",
              "On the other hand, effective co operation must recognise that the systems may not be alike but that they aim to achieve the same goals.\n",
              "This is why the committee agreed to put the two systems (value and property confiscation) of confiscation on an equal footing and to make the text unambiguous on this point.\n",
              "The Explanatory Report adds at para 43 in relation to article 13: Any type of proceedings, independently of their relationship with criminal proceedings and of applicable procedural rules, might qualify in so far as they may result in a confiscation order, provided that they are carried out by judicial authorities and that they are criminal in nature, that is, that they concern instrumentalities or proceeds.\n",
              "Such types of proceedings (which include, for instance, the so called in rem proceedings) are, as indicated under General considerations above, referred to in the text of the Convention as proceedings for the purpose of confiscation.\n",
              "The Explanatory Report adds this further comment at para 48: [According to para 3 of article 13], parties must, for purposes of international co operation in the confiscation of proceeds, be able to apply both the system of property confiscation and the system of value confiscation.\n",
              "This is made clear by article 7, paragraph 2.a.\n",
              "It may imply that Parties which have only a system of property confiscation in domestic cases have to introduce legislation providing for a system of value confiscation of proceeds, including the taking of provisional measures on any realisable property, in order to be able to comply with requests to that effect from value confiscation countries.\n",
              "On the other hand, Parties which have only a system of value confiscation of proceeds in domestic cases must introduce legislation providing for a system of property confiscation of proceeds in order to be able to comply with requests to that effect from property confiscation countries.\n",
              "Confiscation under the Strasbourg Convention has to be ordered by a court following proceedings in relation to a criminal offence or criminal offences see article 1(d).\n",
              "Thus it would seem that the Convention applies to (i) a confiscation order in rem made by party A after conviction of a defendant within its territory in respect of property owned by the defendant situated within the territory of party B; (ii) a confiscation order in rem made by party A in respect of property situated within its territory after conviction of the owner of that property in the territory of party B. One thing is plain beyond doubt.\n",
              "The Strasbourg Convention envisages the courts in one state making an order confiscating property situated in another state.\n",
              "There would thus appear to be established, in respect of the proceeds of crime, an exception to the principle stated by Lord Diplock in Cuthbertson to which I have referred at para 17 above.\n",
              "I believe, however, that the exorbitant in rem confiscation order that the Strasbourg Convention envisages is one where the jurisdiction to make the order is an in personam jurisdiction founded on the conviction of the owner of the property by the court of the state making the order.\n",
              "The much wider exorbitant jurisdiction that SOCA contends is conferred by Part 5 is, so far as I am aware, without precedent anywhere in the world.\n",
              "I can summarise the position as follows.\n",
              "The Strasbourg Convention envisages two types of confiscation proceedings: (i) value confiscation and (ii) confiscation of specific property.\n",
              "It requires parties to give effect, by proceedings within their own jurisdictions and in accordance with their own laws, to requests for assistance in respect of both types of confiscation proceedings that are taking place or have taken place in the jurisdictions of other parties.\n",

              "Confiscation\n",
              "Parts 2, 3 and 4 of POCA make provision for value confiscation by the criminal court, by means of what is described as a confiscation order.\n",
              "Confiscation is a misnomer.\n",
              "The scheme of these Parts involves the imposition of the obligation to make a money payment, which is enforced in the same way as a fine, on a person who has been convicted in the relevant jurisdiction.\n",
              "Thus the order is in personam and it is made as part of the criminal process.\n",
              "The amount of the confiscation order is the amount of benefit that the defendant has obtained from his criminal conduct, calculated in accordance with complex provisions of POCA and subject to an upper limit, which is the amount of the defendants available assets.\n",
              "The provisions in Part 2 relate to England and Wales.\n",
              "Similar provision in relation to Scotland are set out in Part 3 and in relation to Northern Ireland in Part 4.\n",
              "I shall describe the effect of the provisions in Part 2.\n",
              "The confiscation order is made by the Crown Court after a defendant has been convicted by the court or committed to the court for sentencing or for the imposition of a confiscation order.\n",
              "Thus the order is in personam on a defendant who is within the jurisdiction of the Crown Court.\n",
              "To calculate the amount of the confiscation order, the court must (i) identify the property that the defendant initially obtained as a result of or in connection with his criminal conduct and value this; (ii) decide whether the defendant still holds that property, or property that represents it and value this; and (iii) identify all the realisable property that the defendant owns and value this.\n",
              "The confiscation order is made in the higher of the values arrived at under process (i) and process (ii) subject to an upper limit in the amount of the value arrived at under process (iii).\n",
              "Where POCA speaks of property in the context of these processes, the property is worldwide.\n",
              "It matters not where in the world the defendant obtained property through his criminal conduct or where in the world he owns property when his realisable assets fall to be assessed.\n",
              "Thus where property is referred to in sections 76 to 83, which deal with these matters, the property referred to is property wherever situated in the world.\n",
              "Many of the provisions in Parts 2, 3 and 4 are concerned with identifying and securing property in each of the three jurisdictions, either in anticipation of the possibility of the making of a confiscation order or by way of enforcing a confiscation order.\n",
              "The relevant powers are conferred on the Crown Court in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland and on the Court of Session or the sheriff in Scotland.\n",
              "The provisions of the three Parts begin to apply as soon as a criminal investigation has been started in circumstances where there is reasonable cause to believe that the alleged offender has benefited from his criminal conduct.\n",
              "Although the terminology and the precise nature of the measures that can be ordered by the court differ in the case of Scotland from those in the other two jurisdictions, their effect is in substance the same.\n",
              "I shall refer to some of the more material provisions that relate to England and Wales.\n",
              "Section 41 permits the Crown Court to make a restraint order prohibiting any specified person from dealing with any realisable property held by him.\n",
              "The property need not be described in the order.\n",
              "Section 45 permits a constable, inter alios, to seize realisable property to which a restraint order relates to prevent it being taken out of England and Wales.\n",
              "Section 48 permits the Crown Court to appoint a receiver, described as a management receiver in respect of realisable property to which the restraint order applies.\n",
              "Section 50 permits the Crown Court to appoint a receiver, described as an enforcement receiver in relation to realisable property for the purpose of the enforcement of a confiscation order that has been made.\n",
              "While the restraint order takes effect in personam and is of worldwide effect, the provisions that relate to securing and realising property apply to such activities within England and Wales, for each of Parts 2, 3 and 4 deals with activities in the jurisdiction to which it relates.\n",
              "This is made plain by section 443 which provides, inter alia, for the making of Orders in Council (i) for an order made under Part 2 to be enforced in Scotland or Northern Ireland, for an order made under Part 3 to be enforced in England and Wales or Northern Ireland and for an order made under Part 4 to be enforced in England and Wales or Scotland; (ii) for a function of a receiver appointed pursuant to Part 2 to be exercisable in Scotland or Northern Ireland, for a function of an administrator appointed pursuant to Part 3 to be exercisable in England and Wales or Northern Ireland and for a function of a receiver appointed pursuant to Part 4 to be exercisable in England and Wales or Scotland.\n",

              "Orders in Council pursuant to the above provisions have been made.\n",
              "The effect of these provisions is as I have summarised them at para 12(vii) above.\n",

              "Section 74 deals with securing property abroad in anticipation of making a confiscation order and realising property in satisfaction of a confiscation order that has been made.\n",
              "It provides: Enforcement abroad (1) This section applies if (a) any of the conditions in section 40 is satisfied, (b) the prosecutor believes that realisable property is situated in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom (the receiving country), and (c) the prosecutor sends a request for assistance to the Secretary of State with a view to it being forwarded under this section. (2) In a case where no confiscation order has been made, a request for assistance is a request to the government of the receiving country to secure that any person is prohibited from dealing with realisable property. (3) In a case where a confiscation order has been made and has not been satisfied, discharged or quashed, a request for assistance is a request to the government of the receiving country to secure that (a) any person is prohibited from dealing with realisable property; (b) realisable property is realised and the proceeds are applied in accordance with the law of the receiving country. (4) No request for assistance may be made for the purposes of this section in a case where a confiscation order has been made and has been satisfied, discharged or quashed. (5) If the Secretary of State believes it is appropriate to do so he may forward the request for assistance to the government of the receiving country. (6) If property is realised in pursuance of a request under subsection (3) the amount ordered to be paid under the confiscation order must be taken to be reduced by an amount equal to the proceeds of realisation.\n",

(2) A property freezing order is an order that (a) specifies or describes the property to which it applies, and (b) subject to any exclusions (see section 245C(1)(b) and (2)), prohibits any person to whose property the order applies from in any way dealing with the property. (3) An application for a property freezing order may be made without notice if the circumstances are such that notice of the application would prejudice any right of the enforcement authority to obtain a recovery order in respect of any property. (4) The court may make a property freezing order on an application if it is satisfied that the condition in subsection (5) is met and, where applicable, that the condition in subsection (6) is met. (5) The first condition is that there is a good arguable case (a) that the property to which the application for the order relates is or includes recoverable property .\n",

(2) The recovery order must vest the recoverable property in the trustee for civil recovery. (3) But the court may not make in a recovery order (a) any provision in respect of any recoverable property if each of the conditions in subsection (4) or (as the case may be) (5) is met and it would not be just and equitable to do so, or (b) any provision which is incompatible with any of the Convention rights (within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998 (c 42)). (4) In relation to a court in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, the conditions referred to in subsection (3)(a) are that (a) the respondent obtained the recoverable property in good faith, (b) he took steps after obtaining the property which he would not have taken if he had not obtained it or he took steps before obtaining the property which he would not have taken if he had not believed he was going to obtain it, (c) when he took the steps, he had no notice that the property was recoverable, (d) if a recovery order were made in respect of the property, it would, by reason of the steps, be detrimental to him.\n",

              "The very fact that separate provision is made for making property recovery orders in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland indicates that these, and the ancillary steps in relation to securing and realising property, were, at least primarily, designed to apply to property within one of the three jurisdictions of the United Kingdom.\n",

              "Section 269(1) provides that a recovery order is to have effect in relation to any property despite any provision (of whatever nature) which would otherwise prevent, penalise or restrict the vesting of the property.\n",
              "Section 269(2) then specifies a number of rights that are to be overridden by a recovery order.\n",
              "These include a right of return or other similar right, a right of return being defined as any right under a provision for the return or reversion of property in specified circumstances.\n",
              "Mr Eadie submitted that these provisions applied implicitly only to property within the jurisdiction.\n",
              "Mr Jones agreed with this submission, and argued that this was a further indication that recovery orders could only be made in respect of property within the jurisdiction.\n",
              "Hooper LJ dealt with section 269 in a different way.\n",
              "He held at para 155 that section 269(1) should be interpreted as applying only to provisions of English law as it could never have been intended to apply to provisions of the law of a foreign country in relation to property situated in that country.\n",
              "Mr Jones accepted the last part of this proposition, but on the basis that Part 5 as a whole did not apply to property situated in a foreign country.\n",
              "He did not, however, accept that section 269(1) only applied to provisions of English law.\n",
              "He pointed out that under the English rules of conflict of laws foreign law is sometimes determinative of title to property situated in this country.\n",
              "On the premise that Part 5 applies only to property within this jurisdiction there is no basis for restricting the ambit of section 269(1) to rules of English law.\n",
              "I found Mr Jones submissions compelling.\n",
              "Section 269 makes sense if Part 5 is concerned only with property within the United Kingdom.\n",
              "It does not make sense if the property is worldwide.\n",
              "Section 269 deals with provisions that are overridden by a recovery order.\n",
              "Sections 281 and 282 deal with exemptions from the effect of a recovery order.\n",
              "The first of these, under section 281, arises where the victim of the offence to which the recovery order relates demonstrates to the court that the property belongs to him.\n",
              "The implications of this I shall consider when I come, at paras 65 and 66, to deal with the coherence of the scheme laid down by POCA.\n",
              "Section 282 sets out a number of other exemptions, including property held by the Financial Services Authority, property held by a person in his capacity as an insolvency practitioner and property subject to any of a number of charges under United Kingdom statutes.\n",
              "Mr Jones submitted that if property subject to a recovery order were worldwide property, there would have to be equivalent provisions, even if only in general terms, to acknowledge exceptions that would be required in order to accommodate the laws of the countries in which the property was situated.\n",
              "Mr Eadies answer to this was that this was unnecessary as those laws would apply to defeat any claim based on the recovery order in any event.\n",
              "This is a fair response to Mr Jones point.\n",
              "None the less, these domestic provisions in relation to the reach of a recovery order add force to the submission that Part 5 is concerned only with property within the United Kingdom.\n",
              "In summary, apart from the definition of property in section 316(4), and the enigmatic section 286, there is nothing in Part 5, from first to last, that suggests that its application extends to property outside England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n",
              "Many of its provisions clearly relate to property within those jurisdictions.\n",
              "What then of the definition? If a recovery order can only be made in respect of property within England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, can the words in the definition wherever situated, which appear in the definition of property in Part 5, have any application in Part 5 at all?\n",
              "The answer to that question is that there are places in Part 5 where property means property wherever situated, even if a recovery order can only be made in respect of property within the United Kingdom.\n",
              "Section 240 provides in relation to Part 5: (1) This Part has effect for the purposes of (a) enabling the enforcement authority to recover, in civil proceedings before the High Court or Court of Session, property which is, or represents, property obtained through unlawful conduct, Even if property when first used means property within the United Kingdom Courts, the second time that the word is used it unquestionably means property wherever situated.\n",
              "Property within the United Kingdom that represents property obtained by criminal conduct, wherever the property was when obtained, is on any view, covered by Part 5.\n",
              "The same point can be made in relation to property in section 242, which deals with the initial obtaining of property through unlawful conduct, and to the original property in section 305, which deals with tracing property that represents the original property.\n",
              "Thus it is not right to postulate that the words wherever situated in the definition of property in section 316 make no sense if Part 5 does not permit the making of a recovery order in respect of property abroad.\n",
              "For these reasons, giving the words of Part 5 their natural meaning, and ignoring section 286, I would conclude that the provisions that they make in relation to an order for civil recovery apply only within the United Kingdom.\n",
              "Thus far I have been considering the provisions that appear in Part 5.\n",
              "Of perhaps greater significance are the provisions that do not appear in that Part.\n",
              "There are no provisions in relation to enforcement abroad to mirror those that appear at sections 74, 141 and 222 in relation to Parts 2, 3 and 4.\n",
              "Mr Jones submitted to the Court of Appeal that this indicated that Parliament did not intend that civil recovery orders could be made in respect of property situated abroad.\n",
              "Hooper LJ dismissed this submission out of hand at para 113 of his judgment.\n",
              "He held that, having taken the view that the Strasbourg Convention applied to enforcement orders made in civil proceedings, SOCA was entitled to seek to enforce both interim and final Part 5 orders abroad in those countries in which the Convention was in force or in which provisions similar to the Convention had been implemented.\n",
              "I find Hooper LJs conclusions surprising.\n",
              "They are at odds with the scheme of the Strasbourg Convention: see para 30 above.\n",
              "I do not understand how SOCA could seek to enforce abroad interim or final orders under Part 5.\n",
              "Part 5 makes no provisions for SOCA to take steps to secure property or enforce confiscation abroad.\n",
              "The relevant provisions in Part 5 in relation to securing property apply within the United Kingdom: see para 44 above.\n",
              "Realisation of confiscated property is exclusively a matter for the trustee for civil recovery in whom property vests under a recovery order.\n",
              "The suggestion that he would be able to recover property situated abroad is unrealistic: see para 71 below.\n",
              "Had Parliament, or those responsible for drafting POCA, intended Part 5 confiscation to extend to property outside the United Kingdom they would surely have included provisions parallel to section 74.\n",
              "The fact that they did not do so strongly suggests that there was no intention that Part 5 should have extraterritorial effect.\n",
              "Reciprocity\n",
              "I now turn to demonstrate that provisions for giving effect to requests for assistance from other states accord with an interpretation of Part 5 that restricts its application to property within the United Kingdom.\n",
              "One obvious explanation for the provisions of Part 5 is that they were intended to comply with the obligations of the United Kingdom in respect of incoming requests under the Strasbourg Convention, and to afford similar assistance to states not party to that convention.\n",
              "Section 444(1) provides for the making of an Order in Council to make provision for a prohibition on dealing with property which is the subject of an external request and for the realisation of property for the purpose of giving effect to an external order.\n",
              "Section 444(2) provides that such an Order may include provision which (subject to any specified modification) corresponds to any provision of Part 2, 3, 4 or 5, excluding Chapter 3, which deals with cash seizure.\n",
              "Section 447 defines an external request and an external order as follows: (1) An external request is a request by an overseas authority to prohibit dealing with relevant property which is identified in the request. (2) An external order is an order which (a) is made by an overseas court where property is found or believed to have been obtained as a result of or in connection with criminal conduct, and (b) is for the recovery of specified property or a specified sum of money.\n",
              "Thus, where a foreign court makes a finding that property has been, or is believed to have been, obtained as a result of or in connection with criminal conduct and orders the recovery of specified property or a specified sum of money, section 444 provides for an Order in Council that permits realisation of property to give effect to the order of the foreign court.\n",
              "Section 444 addresses both forms of confiscation order referred to in the Explanatory Report to the Strasbourg Convention: see para 28 above.\n",
              "Section 444 does not provide in terms that the property to be realised should be within the United Kingdom.\n",
              "The power conferred by section 444 was exercised by the making of the Order.\n",
              "The Order enables the powers conferred by Parts 2, 3, 4 and 5 of POCA to be exercised for the purpose of giving effect to external requests and external orders, so that the provisions of the Order mirror the provisions of POCA.\n",
              "Part 2 of the Order provides for the Secretary of State to refer an external request in connection with criminal investigation or proceedings, or an external order arising from a criminal conviction, to, among others in England and Wales, the Director of Public Prosecutions.\n",
              "He will then apply to the Crown Court for the exercise of the powers conferred by Part 2.\n",
              "Parts 3 and 4 of the Order make equivalent provisions in respect of Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n",
              "Parts 2, 3 and 4 provide for measures to secure and realise relevant property.\n",
              "Section 447(7) of POCA states that property is relevant property if there are reasonable grounds to believe that it may be needed to satisfy an external order which has been or may be made.\n",
              "Part 2 of the Order is headed Giving Effect in England and Wales to External Requests in Connection with Criminal Investigations or Proceedings and to External Orders Arising from Such Proceedings.\n",
              "Parts 3 and 4 have equivalent headings.\n",
              "Parts 2, 3 and 4 of the Order expressly provide that the external request or order must relate to property in, respectively, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n",
              "In King v Director of the Serious Fraud Office [2009] UKHL 17; [2009] 1 WLR 718 the House of Lords held that the provisions of Part 2 of the Order only permitted a restraint order to be made in respect of property within England and Wales and that the same territorial restriction applied in respect of seizure and enforcement provisions.\n",
              "Why do Parts 2, 3 and 4 of the Order expressly limit the assistance that can be sought by the foreign state to assistance in respect of property within England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland? The answer must be that which I gave in King v Director of the Serious Fraud Office at para 31: If a country wishes assistance from other countries in preserving or recovering property that is related to criminal activity, it makes sense for its request to each of those other countries to be restricted to the provision of assistance in relation to property located within its own jurisdiction.\n",
              "If each country were requested to take steps to procure the preservation or recovery of property on a worldwide basis, this would lead to a confusing, and possibly conflicting, overlap of international requests for assistance.\n",
              "Not only would such multiplication of activity be confusing, it would involve significant and unnecessary multiplication of effort and expense.\n",
              "This reasoning underlies the scheme for assistance laid down in the Strasbourg Convention.\n",
              "Part 5 of the Order provides for the Secretary of State to forward an external order to the enforcement authority in the United Kingdom for the purpose of enabling the enforcement authority to realise recoverable property in civil proceedings for the purpose of giving effect to the external order.\n",
              "The procedure for a civil recovery order in response to the external order is thus put in train.\n",
              "Part 5 of the Order is headed: Giving Effect in the United Kingdom to External Orders by Means of Civil Recovery (my emphasis).\n",
              "In contrast to Parts 2, 3 and 4, however, the body of Part 5 contains no express territorial limitation in relation to the property to which the Order relates.\n",
              "There would seem to be two possible explanations for this.\n",
              "One is that SOCA is correct in contending that Part 5 of POCA has extraterritorial effect and Part 5 of the Order is similarly intended to apply without territorial limitation.\n",
              "The other is that Part 5 of POCA applies only to property within the United Kingdom, so that there was no need to insert a territorial restriction in Part 5 of the Order.\n",
              "I believe that the latter is the correct explanation.\n",
              "In the first place that accords with the heading of Part 5 of the Order.\n",
              "In the second place, if Part 5 of POCA had extraterritorial effect, there would seem no reason to restrict Parts 2, 3 and 4 of the Order to property within the United Kingdom but to impose no such restriction in relation to Part 5.\n",
              "In summary, the terms of the Order accord with an interpretation of POCA that restricts the making of recovery orders under Part 5 to property that is situated within the United Kingdom.\n",
              "A coherent scheme that accords with international law\n",
              "The provisions of Part 5 of POCA comply with the requirements of reciprocity contained in the Strasbourg Convention.\n",
              "If a foreign court makes an order by way of value confiscation, the property of the defendant in England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland can be seized and realised in satisfaction, or part satisfaction, of the order.\n",
              "If, after conviction, a foreign court makes an order for the confiscation of specific proceeds of crime which are in one of the three United Kingdom jurisdictions, they can be seized and realised.\n",
              "However Part 5 of POCA goes further than is necessary to meet the requirements of the Strasbourg Convention.\n",
              "Section 241 requires the court or sheriff to decide on a balance of probabilities whether the property is or represents property obtained through unlawful conduct, irrespective of whether such conduct occurred in the United Kingdom or abroad.\n",
              "If it is, or does, the Court must, subject to the provisions of Part 5, make a recovery order in respect of the property, whether or not any proceedings have been brought for an offence in connection with the property: see section 240(2).\n",
              "The claim form has to be served on the person holding the property and on any person holding associated property which the authority wishes to be subject to a recovery order, wherever domiciled, resident or present (section 243(2)).\n",
              "Part 5 makes complex provision for the protection of the rights of holders of associated property and of third parties who claim ownership of property that is subject to Part 5 proceedings.\n",
              "Those provisions require those persons to make their claims before the court in England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland seised of the Part 5 proceedings.\n",
              "If the jurisdiction described above is founded on the presence of the property in question within the jurisdiction of the Court making the order, the action permitted by Part 5 is neither unreasonable nor contrary to international law.\n",
              "It is perfectly understandable that Parliament should wish to make provision for the confiscation of proceeds of crime held in the United Kingdom by someone outside the jurisdiction and proper that anyone holding that property, or associated property, should be served with the claim to confiscate it and that anyone claiming ownership of it or an interest in it should be expected to assert that claim before the court conducting the confiscation proceedings.\n",
              "Part 5 proceedings brought in respect of property held within the jurisdiction are also likely to be effective, thanks to the provisions in Part 5 for securing and realising the property in question.\n",
              "Thus the scheme of Part 5 is simple and rational.\n",
              "If property is identified in England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland that is believed to be or to represent the proceeds of a crime committed outside the United Kingdom, recovery proceedings can be begun in the jurisdiction concerned.\n",
              "Steps can be taken to secure the property in question and subsequently to realise it within the jurisdiction in question.\n",
              "The proceeds of realisation of the property will be available to defray the cost of the proceedings.\n",
              "The holder of the property, and any holder of associated property or person claiming to own the property can reasonably be expected to take part in the proceedings to assert his right or otherwise to challenge the making of the recovery order.\n",
              "The picture is very different if SOCAs submissions as to the scope of Part 5 proceedings are correct.\n",
              "Part 5 proceedings in respect of property outside the jurisdiction would involve the assertion of an exorbitant jurisdiction in personam without any basis in international law.\n",
              "They would also be likely to prove ineffective.\n",
              "At para 14 of his judgment Hooper LJ cited the following description by the appellants of the effect of SOCAs submissions: Parliament has conferred authority on the enforcement authorities to bring proceedings to vest in a trustee for civil recovery property situated abroad which derives entirely from unlawful conduct abroad where neither the holder of the property, nor any intermediate holders of the property, or property from which the holder's property is derived, have ever been domiciled, resident or present within the jurisdiction; in other words, where there is no connection with the jurisdiction whatsoever.\n",
              "Hooper LJ accepted that this result was startling.\n",
              "He was right to do so.\n",
              "Asserting in personam jurisdiction over the holder of such property, or of associated property, has, as I have said, no precedent in international law.\n",
              "It would not be reasonable to expect the holder of the property, or any person holding associated property or claiming to own the property, to submit to the jurisdiction of a United Kingdom court when neither they nor the property had any connection with that jurisdiction.\n",
              "Any order made would be likely to be made unopposed.\n",
              "In these circumstances the exorbitant confiscation proceedings that had resulted in an unopposed recovery order would be unlikely to bear fruit.\n",
              "Hooper LJ stated on a number of occasions that the recovery order would operate in personam so as to give the trustee for civil recovery a right against the holder of the property.\n",
              "Such a right would, however, be likely to be nugatory, for there would be no basis upon which the trustee for civil recovery could found jurisdiction in the United Kingdom over the holder of the property or any associated property so long as they remained outside the jurisdiction.\n",
              "The fact that they had been served in the Part 5 proceedings would not confer jurisdiction in relation to a claim by the trustee.\n",
              "It was common ground that if in such circumstances the trustee sought to bring a civil claim in respect of the property in the state where it was located, his title would not be likely to be recognised.\n",
              "Hooper LJ advanced the following practical justification for according Part 5 extraterritorial effect.\n",
              "He held, at para 15, that if the appellants were correct: a court in this jurisdiction would be unable to make a civil recovery order in respect of land or other property in Spain bought with the proceeds of crimes committed here by a person resident here.\n",
              "Unable to obtain a civil recovery order, the enforcement authority could not take any steps here to require the person to hand over the property in Spain.\n",
              "Nor (so it appears) could the United Kingdom take enforcement action in Spain pursuant to [the Strasbourg Convention] (to which I return below) because there would be no order of the court to enforce: see paragraph 81 below.\n",
              "This reasoning is not compelling.\n",
              "The appropriate course in the circumstances envisaged by Hooper LJ would be to obtain a confiscation order under Part 2, 3 or 4 and to make a request for assistance via the Secretary of State in accordance with section 74.\n",
              "I can see no compelling reason why Parliament should have wished to confer on SOCA a right to seek a civil recovery order in respect of the proceeds of a crime that was not committed within the United Kingdom where those proceeds are not within the United Kingdom.\n",
              "There will, of course, be the possibility that SOCA will become aware of the existence of property in another jurisdiction that it has reason to believe is, or may be, the proceeds of crime.\n",
              "The natural course in those circumstances will be to pass on such information as it has about the property to the appropriate authorities in the country where the property is situated.\n",
              "For all these reasons, but for the effect of section 286, I would have reached the firm conclusion that the jurisdiction to make a civil recovery order conferred by Part 5 of POCA applied only in respect of property that is situated in England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.\n",
              "What is the effect of section 286?\n",
              "The enigma\n",
              "Section 286 provides: (1) Orders under this Chapter may be made by the Court of Session in respect of a person wherever domiciled, resident or present. (2) Such an order may be made by the Court of Session in respect of moveable property wherever situated. (3) But such an order in respect of a persons moveable property may not be made by the Court of Session where (a) the person is not domiciled, resident or present in Scotland, and (b) the property is not situated in Scotland, unless the unlawful conduct took place in Scotland.\n",
              "It is implicit in this provision that, if POCA did not include it, the jurisdiction that it confers would not exist.\n",
              "Thus section 286(2) purports to confer on the Court of Session the jurisdiction to make an order in respect of moveable property outside Scotland provided either that the holder is domiciled, resident or present in Scotland or the unlawful conduct through which the property was obtained took place in Scotland.\n",
              "The only thing that is agreed about this provision is that it purports to create for Scotland a position that differs from that which the Act provides in relation to the rest of the United Kingdom.\n",
              "This is puzzling as, when moving the amendment that introduced it in the House of Lords, Lord Goldsmith stated on 25 June 2002 that the intention was to achieve the same effect in all the jurisdictions of the United Kingdom: see Hansard (HL Debates), 25 June 2002, vol 636, col 1291.\n",
              "Equally puzzling is section 399 in the Explanatory Notes to the Act, the second sentence of which echoes a comment that Lord Goldsmith made on the same occasion: 399.\n",
              "The section provides that the Court of Session may make an order in respect of a person whether or not he is domiciled, present or resident in the United Kingdom.\n",
              "No similar provision is required in respect of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, due to the jurisdiction of the civil courts and the general provisions on property in section 316.\n",
              "In relation to this note Hooper LJ understandably remarked at para 128 that he could not understand the reference to section 316 of the Act as this applied to all three jurisdictions.\n",
              "No one has been able to proffer a satisfactory explanation for section 286(2).\n",
              "Part 3 of POCA would be the normal and appropriate route for confiscation in relation to property outside Scotland that was or represented proceeds of unlawful conduct that had taken place in Scotland.\n",
              "Why, in the case of Scotland, should special provision be made to bring such property within the scope of Part 5? Section 286(2) remains an enigma.\n",
              "It does not lead me to alter the conclusion that I have expressed in para 74 above, at least in so far as it relates to the position in England and Wales and Northern Ireland.\n",
              "Conclusion\n",
              "The High Court of England and Wales has no jurisdiction under Part 5 to make a recovery order in relation to property outside England and Wales.\n",
              "It follows that the court had no jurisdiction to make the worldwide property freezing order that was made in this case.\n",
              "The PFO appeal should be allowed and the property freezing order redrawn so that it applies only to property within the jurisdiction of the Court.\n",
              "It may be necessary for the Court to hear further argument as to how this should be done, for a question remains, that has not yet been addressed, as to whether the form of the order made in this case is appropriate even if its ambit is restricted to property within the jurisdiction.\n",
              "The foundation of the jurisdiction conferred under Part 5 of POCA is the existence of property believed to be the proceeds of crime.\n",
              "The existence of such property enables SOCA, as the enforcement authority, to serve a claim form on the holder of the property and on any other person who SOCA thinks holds associated property, even if that person is outside the jurisdiction, if SOCA wishes the property to be the subject of a civil recovery order see section 243.\n",
              "Section 243(3) requires the property either to be specified or described in the form in general terms.\n",
              "Section 245A, which I have set out at para 40 above, sets out the requirements of a property freezing order.\n",
              "Subsection (2)(a) states that a property freezing order is one that specifies or describes the property to which it applies.\n",
              "The property freezing order obtained in this case set out schedules of property to which the order applied.\n",
              "But the order was not restricted to specific property.\n",
              "It provided that the prohibition on disposal of assets applies, but is not limited to, the following categories of assets: (1) all real property, including, but not limited to the properties listed at Schedule 1 to this Order; (2) the balances standing to the credit of any bank and/or building society accounts, including, but not limited to the accounts listed at Schedule 2 to this Order; (3) any Personal Equity Plan (PEP); (4) any endowment policy; (5) any securities, including any debentures or shares in any company (wheresoever incorporated); and (6) any chattels, motor vehicles, or other personal property valued in excess of 2000, including, but not limited to the property listed at Schedule 3 to this Order. wheresoever located (whether within England and Wales or otherwise).\n",
              "It is questionable whether these general descriptions specify or describe property as required by section 245A.\n",
              "The property freezing order also required all the PFO appellants, together with the other respondents to the property freezing order, to disclose all their worldwide assets.\n",
              "It is not clear to me how the court had jurisdiction to make such an order.\n",
              "Part 8 of POCA expressly deals with disclosure, which is the subject of the DO appeal.\n",
              "If this Court is invited to make a revised property freezing order in which property is described in terms as general and speculative as have been adopted in this case it will require to be satisfied that they fall within the scope of section 245A.\n",
              "If the Court is invited to include in the revised freezing order an order for disclosure of assets it will require to be satisfied that it has jurisdiction to do so.\n",
              "The DO appeal\n",
              "This appeal challenges the validity of information notices addressed to Mr Perry and his daughters by SOCA pursuant to the disclosure order issued by Judge Kay QC on 8 August 2008: see para 6 above.\n",
              "The disclosure order was issued under Part 8 of POCA, which deals with Investigations.\n",
              "Part 8 applies to both confiscation proceedings under Parts 2, 3 and 4 of POCA and civil recovery proceedings under Part 5.\n",
              "In relation to Part 5 a disclosure order can be made only if property specified in the application for the order is subject to a civil recovery investigation and the order is sought for the purposes of the investigation: see section 357(3)(b).\n",
              "A civil recovery investigation is defined by section 341(2): For the purposes of this Part a civil recovery investigation is an investigation into (a) whether property is recoverable property or associated property, (b) who holds the property, or (c) its extent or whereabouts.\n",
              "Section 357 defines a disclosure order as follows: (4) A disclosure order is an order authorising an appropriate officer to give to any person the appropriate officer considers has relevant information notice in writing requiring him to do, with respect to any matter relevant to the investigation for the purposes of which the order is sought, any or all of the following (a) answer questions, either at a time specified in the notice or at once, at a place so specified; (b) provide information specified in the notice, by a time and in a manner so specified; (c) produce documents, or documents of a description, specified in the notice, either at or by a time so specified or at once, and in a manner so specified. (5) Relevant information is information (whether or not contained in a document) which the appropriate officer concerned considers to be relevant to the investigation.\n",
              "Section 358 sets out the requirements for making a \"disclosure order\": (1) These are the requirements for the making of a disclosure order. (2) There must be reasonable grounds for suspecting that (b) in the case of a civil recovery investigation, the property specified in the application for the order is recoverable property or associated property. (3) There must be reasonable grounds for believing that information which may be provided in compliance with a requirement imposed under the order is likely to be of substantial value (whether or not by itself) to the investigation for the purposes of which the order is sought. (4) There must be reasonable grounds for believing that it is in the public interest for the information to be provided, having regard to the benefit likely to accrue to the investigation if the information is obtained.\n",
              "Section 359(1) provides that a person commits an offence if without reasonable excuse he fails to comply with a requirement imposed on him under a disclosure order.\n",
              "The offence carries a maximum sentence on summary conviction of imprisonment for six months.\n",
              "Section 359(3) provides for the more serious offence of knowingly or recklessly making a false statement in purported compliance with a requirement imposed under a disclosure order.\n",
              "This carries a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment in respect of a conviction after a trial on indictment.\n",
              "SOCAs application for a disclosure order was supported by a witness statement of Vanessa Ewing, a Financial Investigator on SOCAs staff.\n",
              "The application notice named as respondents Mr Perry, Mrs Lea Perry, Mrs Greenspoon, Miss Yael Perry and any other individual or entity specifically associated to the named respondents and property identified as relevant to the civil recovery investigation conducted by the Director General.\n",
              "In para 5.7 Miss Ewing described the property that was subject to the civil recovery investigation as any property held by or on behalf of Perry including, but not limited to, the following: (i) monies which have been credited to or have passed through the following: (a) accounts held by or on behalf of Israel Perry, including accounts held by his wife, Mrs Lea Lili Perry, and/or his two adult daughters, Mrs Tamar Greenspoon and Miss Yael Perry.\n",
              "In explaining why the order was sought in relation to Mr Perrys wife and\n",
              "daughters, Miss Ewing explained: I believe that it is common practice for criminals to use the proceeds of crime to acquire property held in the names of other family members or trusted associates.\n",
              "Persons involved in criminal activity often seek to reduce the amount of money and other property held in their own names in an attempt to minimise their exposure to the risk of confiscation or to avoid paying tax.\n",
              "It is therefore reasonable for the investigation to include property owned by Mrs Lea Lili Perry, Miss Yael Perry and Mrs Tamar Greenspoon in order to ascertain whether such property has a legitimate origin or whether it represents the proceeds of criminal conduct.\n",
              "The Order made by Judge Kay was addressed to all those named in the application notice, included, inappropriately, a penal notice, and conferred authority on SOCA in the general terms of section 357(4).\n",
              "The property referred to by Miss Ewing in her application was described in the most general terms.\n",
              "The purpose of the application, as explained by her, appears to have been to enable SOCA to carry out a roving commission aimed at identifying any property that might be the proceeds of Mr Perrys criminal conduct.\n",
              "A number of notices were issued by Miss Ewing pursuant to the disclosure order.\n",
              "Some sought information of funds in specific accounts.\n",
              "Some sought information in the following terms: (1) Provide the following information under section 357(4)(b) of the Act: (i) A statement of assets held by, or on behalf of, Israel PERRY in the United Kingdom including Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories; (ii) A statement of assets held by, or on behalf of, Israel PERRY in any other country other than the United Kingdom.\n",
              "The information sought includes, but is not limited to, the following: (a) Any assets held by a legal entity of which Mr PERRY is the beneficiary including worldwide companies, trusts and corporations; (b) Any precious metals and gems held by, or on behalf of, Israel PERRY; (c) Any valuable art, antiques and the like held by, or on behalf of, Israel PERRY; (d) Any loans made by, or on behalf of, Israel PERRY; (e) Any real estate held by, or on behalf of, Israel PERRY; (f) Any vehicles, pleasure craft etc held by, or on behalf of, Israel PERRY; (g) Any stocks, bonds, shares, bearer bonds, negotiable instruments, investment funds etc held by, or on behalf of, Israel PERRY; (h) Any bank accounts, in any currency, held by, or on behalf of, Israel PERRY; The exercise carried out by Miss Ewing seems to go beyond the purpose of a civil recovery investigation as defined in section 341(2).\n",
              "That investigation, as I understand the relevant provisions, relates to property whose existence has already been identified.\n",
              "Similar questions arise in relation to the scope of the disclosure order and some of the notices served under it as to those that I have raised in paras 79 to 83 above in relation to the scope of the property freezing order.\n",
              "Under section 357(4) the authority conferred by a disclosure order is restricted to enquiries with respect to any matter relevant to the investigation for the purposes of which the order is sought.\n",
              "It is questionable whether this authority extends beyond seeking information about property whose existence has already been identified.\n",
              "Mr Jones has not, however, sought to challenge the scope of the order or of the notices issued under it.\n",
              "He has made a more fundamental attack on SOCAs authority to issue the notices.\n",
              "Those notices were given to persons who were, and were known by SOCA to be, outside the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.\n",
              "It was Mr Jones submission, advanced before the Court of Appeal, that the authority given by a disclosure order to give disclosure notices only applies to notices given to persons within the jurisdiction.\n",
              "In making this submission Mr Jones relied particularly on the presumption that, unless it clearly provides to the contrary, a statute will not have extraterritorial effect.\n",
              "The majority of the Court of Appeal, Ward and Carnwath LJJ, rejected the appellants attack on the validity of the notices; Richards LJ dissented [2010] EWCA Civ 907; [2011] 1 WLR 542.\n",
              "The gist of the reasoning of Carnwath LJ appears in the following short passage of his judgment: 50. is there any reason why persons who are reasonably considered to have an interest in property validly subject to a disclosure order, and who have a sufficient presence within the jurisdiction for a notice to be effectively given to them, should be treated as outside the legislative grasp of the statutory scheme? 51.\n",
              "As a matter of common sense, it is difficult to see why mere presence in or absence from the country at the time of sending or delivery of the notice is the critical factor.\n",
              "For example, a person normally resident at an address in this country could not sensibly seek to deny that the notice had been given to him at that address, merely because he happened to be out of the country at the time (for example, on a business or holiday trip).\n",
              "Ward LJ proceeded on the premise that a recovery order could be made in respect of property outside the jurisdiction.\n",
              "He commented at para 77 that the extraterritorial effect of Part 5 could not be denied and that he could not see why Part 8 should not act in the same way.\n",
              "For the reasons that I have given I consider that he proceeded on a false premise.\n",
              "The point is a very short one.\n",
              "No authority is required under English law for a person to request information from another person anywhere in the world.\n",
              "But section 357 authorises orders for requests for information with which the recipient is obliged to comply, subject to penal sanction.\n",
              "Subject to limited exceptions, it is contrary to international law for country A to purport to make criminal conduct in country B committed by persons who are not citizens of country A. Section 357, read with section 359, does not simply make proscribed conduct a criminal offence.\n",
              "It confers on a United Kingdom public authority the power to impose on persons positive obligations to provide information subject to criminal sanction in the event of non compliance.\n",
              "To confer such authority in respect of persons outside the jurisdiction would be a particularly startling breach of international law.\n",
              "For this reason alone I consider it implicit that the authority given under section 357 can only be exercised in respect of persons who are within the jurisdiction.\n",
              "Mr Jones referred to a number of other provisions of POCA which, so he submitted, indicated that notices under a disclosure order could only be given to persons within the jurisdiction.\n",
              "He pointed out that Part 8 applies to confiscation as well as to civil recovery.\n",
              "Section 376 as originally drafted included provision for the issue by the judge of a letter of request for the purpose of obtaining information relevant to a confiscation order.\n",
              "He submitted that this provision would have been superfluous if the authority conferred by section 357 extended to persons beyond the United Kingdom.\n",
              "Part 8 gives other investigatory powers, including the power to make a production order in relation to specified material, the power to issue search and seizure warrants and the power to make a customer information order.\n",
              "Mr Jones submitted that the provisions conferring these powers, either as a matter of language or because of the presumption against extraterritoriality, could only be exercised within the United Kingdom.\n",
              "These submissions have some merit and reinforce my view of the limited ambit of section 357.\n",
              "For these reasons I would also allow the DO appeal.\n",
              "I agree with Mr Jones suggestion that the appropriate relief is a declaration that the Disclosure Order made by Judge Kay does not authorise sending information notices to persons who are outside the United Kingdom.\n",
              "LORD REED\n",
              "I agree with Lord Phillips, for all the reasons that he gives, that these appeals must be allowed.\n",
              "In relation to the appeal concerning the property freezing order, however, I wish to consider further section 286 of POCA, in view of the extent to which the submissions of the parties, and the division of opinion in the court, have focused upon that provision.\n",
              "In expressing views about it, I am conscious that the provision is concerned with the jurisdiction of the Court of Session, that these are not Scottish appeals, and that this court has not had the benefit of consideration of the provision by the Scottish courts.\n",
              "In those circumstances, it would be undesirable to express any definite view about the effect of section 286 unless it is necessary to do so in order to determine the present appeal; and, in my view, it is not.\n",
              "Nevertheless, since the provision appears in a United Kingdom statute which must be read and understood as a whole, it is potentially relevant to the construction of the provisions with which the appeal is directly concerned.\n",
              "It was also the subject of much of the argument in the present appeal.\n",
              "Some consideration of its effect is therefore unavoidable.\n",
              "In recognition of that, both parties adduced expert evidence from Scottish counsel before the Court of Appeal.\n",
              "This court, on the other hand, as the final court of appeal in civil matters from all parts of the United Kingdom, has judicial knowledge of Scots, English and Northern Irish law, and may take cognisance of the law of one jurisdiction in an appeal originating in another (Elliot v Joicey [1935] AC 209; 1935 SC (HL) 57; Bank of East Asia Ltd v Scottish Enterprise 1997 SLT 1213).\n",
              "Both the appellants and the respondent were therefore represented by Scottish as well as English counsel.\n",
              "The international background\n",
              "In order to understand the relevant provisions of POCA, including section 286, it is necessary to begin by considering an important aspect of the background to the legislation.\n",
              "As Lord Phillips has explained, POCA is intended to fulfil certain international obligations of the United Kingdom.\n",
              "These include, in particular, the obligations arising under the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Vienna, 20 December 1988), the Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime (Strasbourg, 8 November 1990), and the Council Framework Decision of 26 June 2001 on Money Laundering, the Identification, Tracing, Freezing, Seizing and Confiscation of Instrumentalities and the Proceeds of Crime (OJ 5.7.2001, L182/1).\n",
              "The legislation must therefore be considered in the light of those instruments.\n",
              "For present purposes, the most significant of them are the Vienna Convention and the Strasbourg Convention.\n",
              "The Vienna Convention\n",
              "The Vienna Convention is concerned with drugs offences.\n",
              "Article 5 relates to confiscation, defined by article 1 as meaning the permanent deprivation of property by order of a court or other competent authority.\n",
              "Article 5(1) requires each party to adopt such measures as may be necessary to enable confiscation of proceeds derived from relevant offences.\n",
              "Proceeds are defined in article 1 as meaning any property derived from or obtained, directly or indirectly, through the commission of a relevant offence.\n",
              "Article 5(2) requires each party also to adopt such measures as may be necessary to enable its authorities to identify, trace, and freeze or seize proceeds for the purpose of eventual confiscation.\n",
              "Article 5(4) relates to international co operation.\n",
              "Put shortly, article 5(4)(a) envisages that a request may be made by a party having jurisdiction over an offence to another party in whose territory proceeds referred to in article 5(1) that is to say, proceeds derived from offences are situated.\n",
              "On receipt of such a request, the party requested must either submit the request to its competent authorities for the purpose of obtaining an order of confiscation and, if such order is granted, give effect to it, or it must submit to its competent authorities an order of confiscation issued by the requesting party, with a view to giving effect to it in so far as it relates to proceeds situated in its territory.\n",
              "Article 5(4)(b) in addition provides for effect to be given to requests for the taking of provisional measures for the purpose of eventual confiscation.\n",
              "In terms of article 5(5)(a), proceeds confiscated by a party pursuant to article 5(4) are to be disposed of by that party according to its domestic law.\n",
              "The Strasbourg Convention\n",
              "The Strasbourg Convention is wider in its subject matter than the Vienna Convention, in that it applies to criminal offences generally, but narrower in its geographical scope, in so far as it was made under the auspices of the Council of Europe rather than the United Nations, and fewer states are party to it.\n",
              "Chapter III is concerned with international co operation in relation to confiscation of the proceeds of crime.\n",
              "The relevant provisions have been set out by Lord Phillips.\n",
              "Confiscation is defined by article 1(d) as meaning a penalty or a measure, ordered by a court following proceedings in relation to a criminal offence or criminal offences resulting in the final deprivation of property.\n",
              "It is to be noted that, as in the Vienna Convention, the term confiscation has a wider scope than a confiscation order within the meaning of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of POCA, and is apt to include recovery orders of the kind for which Part 5 makes provision.\n",
              "Section 1 of Chapter III of the Convention, comprising article 7, sets out the general principles in relation to international co operation.\n",
              "In particular, article 7(2) imposes an obligation upon each party to the Convention to adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to enable it to comply, under the conditions provided for in that chapter, with requests for confiscation, and with requests for investigative assistance and provisional measures with a view to confiscation.\n",
              "Section 2, comprising articles 8 to 10, is concerned with investigative assistance.\n",
              "In terms of article 8, in particular, parties undertake to afford each other, upon request, the widest possible measure of assistance in the identification and tracing of proceeds and other property liable to confiscation.\n",
              "Such assistance is to include any measure providing and securing evidence as to, amongst other matters, the existence and location of such property.\n",
              "Section 3, comprising articles 11 and 12, is concerned with provisional measures.\n",
              "In terms of article 11(1), in particular, parties are obliged, at the request of another party which has instituted criminal proceedings or proceedings for the purpose of confiscation, to take the necessary provisional measures, such as freezing or seizing, to prevent any dealing in, transfer or disposal of property which, at a later stage, may be the subject of a request for confiscation or which might be such as to satisfy the request.\n",
              "Section 4, comprising articles 13 to 17, is concerned with confiscation.\n",
              "Article 13, in particular, is concerned with the obligation to confiscate.\n",
              "Following the dual scheme created by article 5(4) of the Vienna Convention, article 13(1) of the Strasbourg Convention envisages alternative means by which a party may respond to a request made by another party for the confiscation of proceeds of crime which are situated in its territory.\n",
              "The first alternative, set out in article 13(1)(a), is that the requested party may enforce a confiscation order made by a court of the requesting party.\n",
              "The second alternative, set out in article 13(1)(b), is that the requesting party may submit a request to the competent authorities of the requested party so that the latter may obtain and enforce a confiscation order.\n",
              "Finally, in relation to the Strasbourg Convention, article 15 follows article 5(5)(a) of the Vienna Convention in providing that any property confiscated by the requested party shall be disposed of by that party in accordance with its domestic law, unless otherwise agreed by the parties concerned.\n",
              "As I shall explain, that provision is not reflected in the effect of a recovery order made under Part 5 of POCA.\n",
              "The contrast is relevant to the question whether such orders can be of the kind contemplated by article 13(1)(a) of the Convention, and therefore to the question whether such orders may fall within the scope of that exception to the ordinary principles of international law.\n",
              "The Framework Decision\n",
              "The Framework Decision seeks to ensure the effective implementation of the Strasbourg Convention within the EU.\n",
              "It does not however add anything of significance in relation to the issues with which the appeal is concerned.\n",
              "Parts 2, 3 and 4 of POCA\n",
              "Parts 2, 3 and 4 of POCA are concerned primarily with confiscation orders: orders, that is to say, made against a person convicted in criminal proceedings, for the payment of a sum of money equivalent to the value of any property or pecuniary advantage obtained as a result of or in connection with his criminal conduct (or such lesser amount as may be available).\n",
              "Such orders can be made in criminal proceedings in England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland: see section 6 in relation to England and Wales, section 92 in relation to Scotland, and section 156 in relation to Northern Ireland.\n",
              "The order operates in personam, and the person against whom it is made is necessarily subject to the criminal jurisdiction of the court which makes the order.\n",
              "The courts are also empowered to order provisional measures.\n",
              "In particular, a restraint order can be made if, put shortly, a criminal investigation or criminal proceedings have been started in England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, and there is reasonable cause to believe that the alleged offender or defendant has benefited from his criminal conduct: see sections 41, 120 and 190.\n",
              "Such orders again operate in personam.\n",
              "The courts can also order enforcement measures, including measures authorising the securing and realisation of property.\n",
              "Such orders operate in rem.\n",
              "Parts 2, 3 and 4 each contain a provision concerned with overseas jurisdictions.\n",
              "If the conditions for the making of a restraint order are met, and the prosecutor believes that realisable property that is to say, property held by the defendant or by the recipient of a tainted gift is situated in a country outside the United Kingdom, then the prosecutor can send a request to the Secretary of State, with a view to its being forwarded to the government of the country where the property is situated: see sections 74, 141 and 222.\n",
              "In a case where no confiscation order has been made, the request is to secure that any person is prohibited from dealing with the property.\n",
              "If a confiscation order has been made and has not been satisfied, the request is also to secure that the property is realised and the proceeds are applied in accordance with the law of the requested country.\n",
              "These provisions fall within the ambit of articles 5(4) and (5) of the Vienna Convention and 11 and 13(3) of the Strasbourg Convention.\n",
              "It appears, therefore, that although property is defined by section 84(1), and by the corresponding provisions for Scotland and Northern Ireland, as all property wherever situated, and the powers to make restraint orders under sections 41, 120 and 190 can therefore be exercised in relation to property situated overseas, it is envisaged that the securing and realisation of such property will be dealt with by means of requests to foreign governments for assistance.\n",
              "That is as one would expect, since it is only the authorities of the jurisdiction where the property is situated which have the power to make effective orders of that nature in respect of such property.\n",
              "The wide definition of property is nevertheless essential in the context of Parts 2, 3 and 4, not only for the purposes of sections 74, 141 and 222 but more generally.\n",
              "In particular, as I have explained, a confiscation order is an order for the payment of a sum of money equal to the value of any property or pecuniary advantage obtained by the defendant from his criminal conduct.\n",
              "Although the court must have jurisdiction over the defendant in the criminal proceedings, there is no reason why the property obtained as a result of or in connection with the offence need also be situated within the United Kingdom, or within the part of the United Kingdom where the court is located.\n",
              "Part 5 of POCA\n",
              "As section 240(1) of POCA states, Part 5 has two purposes.\n",
              "The first, with which the present case is concerned, is to enable the enforcement authority to recover, in civil proceedings before the High Court or the Court of Session, property which is or represents property obtained through unlawful conduct.\n",
              "The Act thus creates an entirely new form of remedy.\n",
              "Section 240(2) makes it clear that such proceedings may be brought whether or not any criminal proceedings have been brought for an offence in connection with the property.\n",
              "Section 241 explains what is meant by unlawful conduct, and in particular that such conduct may occur in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.\n",
              "Accordingly, in distinction to Parts 2, 3 and 4, proceedings can be brought under Part 5 in circumstances where the court has no jurisdiction in respect of the offence in question.\n",
              "Chapter 2 of Part 5 is concerned with civil recovery.\n",
              "In particular, sections 243 and 244 are concerned with proceedings for recovery orders in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, and in Scotland, respectively.\n",
              "Each provision permits proceedings for a recovery order to be taken against any person who the enforcement authority thinks holds recoverable property, and requires the enforcement authority to serve the claim form or application upon the respondent wherever domiciled, resident or present.\n",
              "Accordingly, proceedings for a recovery order can be brought in circumstances where not only the court has no jurisdiction in respect of the offence in question, but the defendant is not domiciled, resident or present within the jurisdiction of the court.\n",
              "Having read only this far into the legislation, if one were to ask what connecting factor is required in order for the Court of Session to have jurisdiction in proceedings under Part 5, if the respondent is not domiciled, resident or present in Scotland, and if the Scottish courts do not have criminal jurisdiction over him, the answer which one would naturally expect is that the necessary connecting factor is the situation within Scotland of the property which is sought to be recovered.\n",
              "It is difficult to see what else it might be.\n",
              "It is however necessary to read further to find out whether that expectation is well founded.\n",
              "This is perhaps an appropriate point at which to note SOCAs submission that there need not be any connecting factor: POCA, it is argued, enables the enforcement authorities to bring proceedings in the High Court or the Court of Session to vest property situated abroad in a trustee for civil recovery, even where there is no connection with the United Kingdom whatsoever.\n",
              "As it is put in SOCAs written case, Parliament has decided that a Chinese thief, living in China, who has stolen property in China from a Chinese citizen may be the subject of civil recovery action.\n",
              "It is however inherently unlikely that such a result could have been intended by Parliament: in such circumstances, there would be no reason for the holder of the property to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of this country, and no likelihood that any order granted by those courts without appearance would be given effect overseas.\n",
              "Again, however, it is necessary to examine the legislation further in order to determine what Parliament has done.\n",
              "A recovery order must vest the recoverable property in the trustee for civil recovery: section 266(2).\n",
              "The order may sever any property: section 266(7).\n",
              "Furthermore, the order may impose conditions as to the manner in which the trustee for civil recovery may deal with any property vested by the order for the purpose of realising it: section 266(8).\n",
              "The trustee for civil recovery is a person appointed by the court to give effect to a recovery order: section 267(1).\n",
              "His functions include securing the detention, custody or preservation of any property vested in him by the recovery order and realising the value of the property, other than money: section 267(3).\n",
              "By virtue of section 267(6), he has the powers mentioned in Schedule 7.\n",
              "The first of these is power to sell the property: paragraph 1.\n",
              "There is no equivalent of these provisions in Parts 2, 3 or 4.\n",
              "These provisions suggest strongly, if not conclusively, that a recovery order operates in rem to transfer title to the property to the trustee.\n",
              "That is the usual, although not invariable, sense in which the concept of vesting is employed, and that sense is consistent with the power to sever the property, and with the power of the trustee to sell the property and his function of realising its value.\n",
              "This interpretation of section 266 derives further support from section 269, which is concerned with rights, such as rights of pre emption or irritancy, which might otherwise be triggered by the vesting of the property in the trustee.\n",
              "Section 269 provides, so far as material: (1) A recovery order is to have effect in relation to any property despite any provision (of whatever nature) which would otherwise prevent, penalise or restrict the vesting of the property. (2) A right of pre emption, right of irritancy, right of return or other similar right does not operate or become exercisable as a result of the vesting of any property under a recovery order.\n",
              "A right of return means any right under a provision for the return or reversion of property in specified circumstances. (3) Where property is vested under a recovery order, any such right is to have effect as if the person in whom the property is vested were the same person in law as the person who held the property and as if no transfer of the property had taken place.\n",
              "The most significant of these provisions for present purposes is section 269(3), since that provision implies that the vesting of property under a recovery order involves the transfer of the property, so that it is held by the trustee rather than by the person who formerly held it.\n",
              "It was also accepted on behalf of SOCA that section 269(2) is one of a number of provisions in Part 5 which can only apply to property if POCA forms part of the lex situs: in other words, if the property is situated in one of the parts of the United Kingdom.\n",
              "One would ordinarily expect an order having the effect of transferring a real right of ownership to apply only in relation to property situated in the territory of the state where the order is made.\n",
              "As Lord Mance, delivering the judgment of the Board, said in Pattni v Ali [2006] UKPC 51; [2007] 2 AC 85 (para 24): Their Lordships also note the existence of a more general principle.\n",
              "The actual transfer or disposition of property is, in principle, a matter for the legislature and courts of the jurisdiction where the property is situate (state A), and will be recognised accordingly by courts in any other state (state B) It follows from it, conversely, that in the unlikely event that the courts of state A were to purport actually to transfer or dispose of property in state B, the purported transfer or disposal should not be recognised as effective in courts outside state A.\n",
              "That principle would apply with particular force if the order were made for the purpose of seizure or confiscation: Socit Eram Shipping Co Ltd v Cie Internationale de Navigation [2003] UKHL 30; [2004] 1 AC 260, para 54 per Lord Hoffmann; Government of the Republic of Spain v National Bank of Scotland 1939 SC 413.\n",
              "Lord Justice Clerk Aitchison said in the latter case (at pp 433 434): such decrees of a foreign country as purport to have extra territorial effect, and to attach property in a subject situated, and at a time when it is situated, within this country or its territorial waters, will not be recognised by our laws and courts.\n",
              "As I have previously explained, however, article 5(4) of the Vienna Convention and article 13(1)(a) of the Strasbourg Convention allow for the possibility that a party may make an order confiscating property situated in the territory of another party, to which the latter party may choose to give effect, but is not obliged to do so.\n",
              "It therefore cannot be taken for granted that POCA does not allow for that possibility.\n",
              "It is necessary to examine the legislation further in order to decide whether POCA does so or not.\n",
              "Other provisions in Chapter 2 concern provisional measures.\n",
              "The available measures in England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland, are property freezing orders and interim receiving orders.\n",
              "The corresponding measures in Scotland are prohibitory property orders and interim administration orders.\n",
              "A property freezing order and a prohibitory property order are orders that prohibit any person to whose property the order applies from dealing with the property: sections 245A(2)(b) and 255A(2)(b).\n",
              "The court can make such an order only if it is satisfied that there is a good arguable case that the property to which the application for the order relates is or includes recoverable property, and that, if any of it is not recoverable property, it is associated property: sections 245A(4) and (5), and 255A(4) and (5).\n",
              "One consequence of that requirement is that such orders can be made only in respect of property which is, in principle, capable of being made the subject of a recovery order, or is mixed with such property in such a way as to be associated property as defined in section 245.\n",
              "If a recovery order operates in rem, as one might infer for the reasons I have explained at paragraphs 123 to 125, it follows that the scope of property freezing orders and prohibitory property orders is more limited than the nature of the orders themselves might otherwise have led one to expect.\n",
              "Part 5 contains no provision concerned with overseas jurisdictions.\n",
              "There is, in particular, no equivalent of sections 74, 141 and 222.\n",
              "This contrast with Parts 2, 3 and 4 (and also with Part 8, as originally enacted: see section 376) provides further support for the view that recovery orders are concerned solely with property situated within the part of the United Kingdom where the order was made.\n",
              "If such orders had extraterritorial scope, the absence of any provision corresponding to sections 74, 141 and 222 would be difficult to understand.\n",
              "In that connection, it is also relevant to note that Part 5 requires that the realised proceeds of property vested in the trustee must be applied in accordance with section 280.\n",
              "That section requires that the net proceeds, after payment of the remuneration and expenses of the trustee, must be paid to the enforcement authority.\n",
              "No provision is made for the possibility that the proceeds of realization of property situated in another jurisdiction might be applied in accordance with the law of that jurisdiction, as envisaged by article 5(5)(a) of the Vienna Convention and article 15 of the Strasbourg Convention.\n",
              "In that respect, recovery orders again differ from confiscation orders made under Parts 2, 3 and 4: in the case of those orders, sections 74(3), 141(3) and 222(3) provide, in relation to enforcement abroad, that the request is to be that realisable property is realised and the proceeds are applied in accordance with the law of the receiving country.\n",
              "I shall return to section 286, which is concerned with the power of the Court of Session to make orders under Chapter 2 of Part 5, and to section 316(4), which defines property for the purposes of Part 5.\n",
              "Part 11 of POCA\n",
              "It is also relevant to note one of the provisions in Part 11 of POCA, which is concerned with co operation.\n",
              "Section 444 deals with external requests and orders.\n",
              "It allows provision to be made by Order in Council for a prohibition on dealing with property which is the subject of an external request, or for the realisation of property for the purpose of giving effect to an external order.\n",
              "An external request is a request by an overseas authority to prohibit dealing with property which may be needed to satisfy an external order which has been or may be made: section 447(1) and (7).\n",
              "An external order is an order made by an overseas court where property is found or believed to have been obtained as a result of or in connection with criminal conduct, and is for the recovery of specified property or a specified sum of money.\n",
              "Such an Order in Council may include provision which (subject to any specified modifications) corresponds to any provision of Part 2, 3 or 4 or Part 5, except Chapter 3, which concerns the recovery of cash in summary proceedings.\n",
              "Section 444 thus enables articles 11 and 13(1) of the Strasbourg Convention, and the corresponding provisions of the Vienna Convention, to be implemented by the United Kingdom.\n",
              "The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Requests and Orders) Order 2005 (SI 2005/3181) was made under sections 444 and 459(2) of POCA.\n",
              "Part 5 of the Order concerns recovery orders, and contains articles corresponding to sections 286 and 316(4) of POCA: see articles 197 and 213(4) respectively.\n",
              "The Order was construed by the House of Lords in King v Director of the Serious Fraud Office [2009] UKHL 17; [2009] 1 WLR 718 as conferring jurisdiction upon the Crown Court to make a restraint order in response to an external request only where the request concerned property in England and Wales.\n",
              "The same territorial requirement was also held to apply to the seizure and enforcement provisions of Part 2 of the Order.\n",
              "Although the terms of the Order differ in some significant respects from the terms of POCA, the speech of Lord Phillips, with which the other members of the committee agreed, contains observations which are equally germane to the present case.\n",
              "In particular, Lord Phillips rejected the contention that an Order made under section 444 might have been intended to enable foreign countries to obtain worldwide orders from the British courts (para 37).\n",
              "His Lordship also observed that, although property was defined by section 447(4) of POCA as meaning property wherever situated, whether the word bore that meaning depended on the context in which the word was used.\n",
              "Thus, where the Order expressly or by implication referred to property in England and Wales, it necessarily referred only to property there situated (para 37).\n",
              "Section 316(4)\n",
              "It is necessary next to consider section 316(4), which defines property for the purposes of Part 5 as all property wherever situated.\n",
              "At first sight, that might be thought to entail that the power to make a recovery order extended to property anywhere in the world, provided that it had been obtained through unlawful conduct occurring anywhere in the world and was therefore recoverable property as defined in section 304(1).\n",
              "As I have explained, however, there are a number of factors which point away from that conclusion.\n",
              "To recap: (1) Part 5, unlike Parts 2, 3 and 4, makes no provision in respect of overseas jurisdictions; (2) Part 5, unlike Parts 2, 3 and 4, makes no provision for the proceeds of realisation of recoverable property to be applied in accordance with foreign law, as contemplated by article 5(5)(a) of the Vienna Convention and article 15 of the Strasbourg Convention; (3) recovery orders under Part 5, unlike confiscation and restraint orders under Parts 2, 3 and 4, appear on the face of the provisions (notably sections 266, 267, 269 and Schedule 7) to operate in rem; (4) orders taking effect in rem ordinarily apply only to property situated within the territorial jurisdiction of the court; (5) there is a presumption that Parliament does not intend to legislate in respect of property outside the United Kingdom, and in particular that legislation is not intended to authorise the seizure or confiscation of property situated outside the United Kingdom; (6) courts in the United Kingdom have no power to make effective orders purporting to transfer real rights of ownership of property situated outside the jurisdiction of the court; and (7) it is accepted that references to property in a number of other provisions of POCA, including provisions of Part 5, can refer only to property situated in the United Kingdom.\n",
              "Some of these points have greater force than others.\n",
              "Cumulatively, however, they provide compelling support for the conclusion that the ambit of recovery orders is intended to be confined to property located within the part of the United Kingdom where the court in question exercises jurisdiction.\n",
              "Subject to section 286, it appears therefore that, although property is defined so widely by section 316(4) that the power to make recovery orders under section 266 might be understood as extending to property located overseas, such an interpretation of section 266 would be mistaken: in the context of the section, the word property has to be understood as referring only to property situated within the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court or the Court of Session, as the case may be.\n",
              "The wide definition of property is nevertheless essential in the context of other provisions of Part 5.\n",
              "In particular, the tracing provisions in Part 5 have the consequence that a recovery order may be appropriate in respect of property located within the jurisdiction of the court which represents property unlawfully obtained elsewhere: see, for example, section 305.\n",
              "Civil jurisdiction in the Scottish courts\n",
              "Before coming finally to section 286, it is necessary to explain in outline the relevant aspects of Scots law in relation to jurisdiction, apart from POCA.\n",
              "I should emphasise that my purpose here is merely to explain matters in the most general terms, so as to provide some background against which to attempt to understand the effect of section 286.\n",
              "In most ordinary civil proceedings before the Scottish courts, jurisdiction is regulated by the rules contained in Schedule 8 to the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982, as amended.\n",
              "In the present context, it is convenient to begin with rule 5(1)(a), which confers upon the courts for the place where immovable property is situated exclusive jurisdiction in proceedings which have as their object rights in rem in immovable property (sic: the terms movable and immovable are derived from the 1968 Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters rather than the Scots law of property, which distinguishes between heritable and moveable property.\n",
              "It is the latter terminology which is employed in section 316(4) of POCA).\n",
              "The exclusive jurisdiction of the forum rei is reinforced by rule 5(2), which precludes a Scottish court from exercising jurisdiction in a case where immovable property is situated outside Scotland and the court would have exclusive jurisdiction if the property were situated in Scotland.\n",
              "A similar rule applies to the allocation of jurisdiction within the United Kingdom: Schedule 4, rule 11(a)(i).\n",
              "Even before the enactment of the 1982 Act, that approach had long been established under the common law.\n",
              "For example, in Cathcart v Cathcart (1902) 12 SLT 182 Lord Low declined to grant a declarator that the pursuer was entitled to a liferent of land situated in England.\n",
              "He observed, at p 185: Real estate in England is beyond the jurisdiction of the Scotch courts Further, if decree of declarator in terms of the second conclusion was pronounced, this court would have no power to give practical effect to the right thereby declared.\n",
              "The pursuer would require to go to England to obtain his remedy.\n",
              "Would the English courts, according to the principles of international law, be bound to recognise and act upon the declarator of this court? I am of opinion that they would not I think that the answer would be that it was for the court of the country where the real estate was situated to say what was the result, as regards the rights of the parties [of the relevant events].\n",
              "I am therefore of opinion that the question is one with which this court is not competent to deal.\n",
              "In relation to proceedings concerned with moveable property, Schedule 8 contains a number of relevant rules.\n",
              "Under rule 1, the general rule is that persons can be sued in Scotland if they are domiciled there.\n",
              "The concept of domicile is defined for this purpose on the basis of residence: section 41.\n",
              "Under rule 2, there are also a number of special grounds on which the Scottish courts may have jurisdiction.\n",
              "In particular, under rule 2(i) a person may be sued in Scotland in proceedings which are brought to assert, declare or determine proprietary or possessory interests, or rights of security, in or over movable property, or to obtain authority to dispose of movable property, if the property is situated in Scotland.\n",
              "There are in addition other rules which may be relevant to confer jurisdiction in particular circumstances.\n",
              "Broadly similar rules apply to the allocation of jurisdiction within the United Kingdom, under Schedule 4, rules 1 and 3(h)(ii).\n",
              "The Scottish courts may therefore have jurisdiction in proceedings concerned with the ownership of moveable property situated outside Scotland.\n",
              "In practice, however, as I have explained, the courts in Scotland, as in the other parts of the United Kingdom, would be unlikely to make an order in rem purporting to transfer or dispose of property in another state.\n",
              "Accordingly, summarising the matter broadly, proceedings concerned with rights in rem can ordinarily be brought in the Scottish courts in relation to heritable property only if the property is situated in Scotland.\n",
              "They can ordinarily be brought in relation to moveable property if the property is situated in Scotland or if the defender is domiciled in Scotland.\n",
              "They cannot otherwise ordinarily be brought, in the absence of particular circumstances in which other grounds of jurisdiction may arise (for example, under rule 2(h) of Schedule 8).\n",
              "There are a number of circumstances where jurisdiction is not governed by Schedules 4 or 8.\n",
              "In particular, those schedules do not affect the operation of any enactment which confers jurisdiction on a Scottish court in respect of a specific subject matter on specific grounds: sections 17(1) and 21(1)(a) of the 1982 Act.\n",
              "Section 286 of POCA is an example of such an enactment.\n",
              "Section 286\n",
              "I can now turn at last to section 286 itself.\n",
              "It is headed Scope of powers (Scotland), and provides: (1) Orders under this Chapter may be made by the Court of Session in respect of a person wherever domiciled, resident or present. (2) Such an order may be made by the Court of Session in respect of moveable property wherever situated. (3) But such an order in respect of a person's moveable property may not be made by the Court of Session where (a) the person is not domiciled, resident or present in Scotland, and (b) the property is not situated in Scotland, unless the unlawful conduct took place in Scotland.\n",
              "The words this Chapter refer to Chapter 2 of Part 5 of POCA, which as I have explained is concerned with civil recovery.\n",
              "The orders which may be made by the Court of Session under Chapter 2 are recovery orders, prohibitory property orders, interim administration orders and consent orders (made under section 276).\n",
              "Since these orders can only be made in respect of property which is at least arguably recoverable (or associated property), it is the extent of the courts jurisdiction in relation to the power to make recovery orders which is of critical importance.\n",
              "Section 286 provides further support for the conclusion that the definition of property in section 316(4) does not have the effect of enabling a recovery order to be made under section 266 in respect of property anywhere in the world.\n",
              "If section 266, read with section 316(4), had that effect, the provision made by section 286(2) in respect of moveable property would be redundant, and the distinction implicitly drawn between heritable and moveable property would be inexplicable.\n",
              "Section 286(3) is also difficult to reconcile with such an interpretation, since it qualifies the jurisdiction conferred by section 286(2) in relation to moveable property.\n",
              "This supports the view that section 266 does not itself define the courts jurisdiction to make a recovery order, but confers a power which can be exercised in circumstances in which the court possesses jurisdiction, based upon some independent foundation.\n",
              "A distinction has to be drawn, that is to say, between the nature of the power conferred by section 266, on the one hand, and the jurisdiction of the court: a jurisdiction arising, in relation to the Court of Session, from section 286 and from the background rules of civil jurisdiction, so far as they are not implicitly displaced.\n",
              "If recovery orders operate in rem, and the jurisdiction of the Scottish courts to make orders of that character is not ordinarily conditional upon the holder of the property being domiciled, resident or present in Scotland, section 286(1) is as one would expect.\n",
              "It also enables the jurisdiction of the court to meet the requirements of article 5(4) of the Vienna Convention and article 13 of the Strasbourg Convention.\n",
              "The absence from section 286 of any provision in respect of heritable property is also as one would expect.\n",
              "As I have explained, one would not expect the court to have jurisdiction to make orders in rem in respect of heritable property outside Scotland.\n",
              "Since the court would not possess such a jurisdiction under the 1982 Act or under the common law, there is no necessity for POCA to alter that position.\n",
              "In relation to moveable property, on the other hand, the position is different.\n",
              "As I have explained, the ordinary rules of civil jurisdiction in Scotland enable the courts to exercise jurisdiction in relation to moveable property outside Scotland (including questions concerning proprietary rights in respect of such property), provided the defender is domiciled in Scotland or other requirements specified in the 1982 Act are met.\n",
              "At the same time, one would not expect the court to exercise a power to transfer or dispose of moveable property situated outside Scotland, in accordance with the principle explained in Pattni v Ali [2006] UKPC 51; [2007] 2 AC 85, or to purport to confiscate moveable property situated in another sovereign state, in accordance with the principles discussed in Socit Eram Shipping Co Ltd v Cie Internationale de Navigation [2003] UKHL 30; [2004] 1 AC 260 and in Government of the Republic of Spain v National Bank of Scotland 1939 SC 413.\n",
              "The width of the courts formal jurisdiction does not therefore entail that the court will exercise its powers to the limits of its jurisdiction, where for example such an exercise would be ineffective or would contravene recognized principles of international law.\n",
              "The jurisdiction conferred by section 286(2) and (3) in relation to moveable property differs in a number of respects from the courts ordinary jurisdiction: instead of the possible grounds of jurisdiction set out, in particular, in rules 1 and 2 of Schedule 8 to the 1982 Act, the apparent effect of section 286(2) and (3) is to confer jurisdiction upon the court, for the purposes of chapter 2 of Part 5 of POCA, where moveable property is situated in Scotland, and also where it is situated elsewhere and either (a) the holder of the property is domiciled, resident or present in Scotland, or (b) the unlawful conduct took place in Scotland.\n",
              "The rationale of such a wide jurisdiction is not obvious, given that the power conferred by section 266 to make a recovery order (and therefore the powers to make other orders in respect of property which is at least arguably recoverable) is more limited in scope, as I have explained.\n",
              "In the circumstances, counsel referred the court to the legislative history of the provision, and in particular to statements made in Parliament during the passage of the Bill.\n",
              "These statements, even if admissible as an aid to interpretation, do not however provide any clear explanation of the intention of section 286(2) and (3).\n",
              "They confirm that section 286 was intended to regulate the question of jurisdiction, and indicate that its effect was intended to be the same as was achieved for England and Wales and Northern Ireland by a combination of the provisions on property in section 316 and the general rules on the jurisdiction of the civil courts.\n",
              "One matter on which all parties to these proceedings are agreed, however, is that that is not the case: on any view, the position in England and Wales and Northern Ireland is not the same as that set out in section 286(2) and (3).\n",
              "It appears therefore to be possible that the drafting of section 286(2) and (3) may have reflected a misunderstanding.\n",
              "Since POCA deals with matters falling partly within the competence of the Scottish Parliament, proceedings also took place in that Parliament in accordance with the arrangements known colloquially as the Sewel convention: see Hansard (HL Debates), 21 July 1998, col 791.\n",
              "Section 286 was not however specifically considered, and neither the discussion in the Parliament nor the Sewel memorandum prepared by the Scottish Executive appears to shed any light on its intended effect.\n",
              "As Sir Winston Churchill once said in another context, it is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.\n",
              "The effect of section 286 is however not of critical importance in the present context.\n",
              "If section 266 is to be understood as referring to property within the territorial jurisdiction of the relevant court, for the reasons I have explained, then it follows that the power conferred by section 266 is consequently restricted to such property.\n",
              "The fact that the jurisdiction of the Court of Session, as regulated by section 286 for the purposes of chapter 2 of Part 5, may be wider than that of the High Court does not alter the meaning and effect of section 266 in relation to the High Court, which is the issue at the heart of the present appeal.\n",
              "If section 266 confers the same power upon courts in all parts of the United Kingdom, as it appears to do, then it may be that section 286 has equally little practical effect upon the ambit of recovery orders made by the Court of Session.\n",
              "That is not however an issue which need be, or ought to be, decided in the present case.\n",
              "SIR ANTHONY HUGHES\n",
              "I respectfully agree with Lord Phillips that both appeals must be allowed, and for the reasons which he gives.\n",
              "I add only some very brief words about the PFO appeal.\n",
              "For my part, if it were possible to construe the complex provisions of POCA in such a way as to admit of limited extraterritorial effect for Part 5, but only where there is a sufficient jurisdictional connection between a part of the UK and the criminal proceeds, I should have wished to do so.\n",
              "I am, however, reluctantly persuaded that this cannot be achieved by construction and would involve illegitimately re writing the statute.\n",
              "For the reasons explained by Hooper LJ, cited by Lord Phillips at para 72 above, it would make excellent sense for the English court to have jurisdiction to make a civil recovery order in relation to real or personal property in Spain bought with the profits of crime by an English criminal, or by someone who committed his offence in England and Wales.\n",
              "It will not always be possible to achieve removal of such proceeds by means of a post conviction confiscation order under Part 2; there may, for a number of reasons, be no conviction for example the criminal may be dead, or untriable because resident in a country from which no extradition is possible.\n",
              "It seems to me that the kind of jurisdictional links contemplated by section 286 for the limited case of moveable property in the case of Scottish courts could sensibly serve as a model for all property and for all UK courts: that is to say links (1) because the crime was committed here, (2) because the offender or holder of the property is domiciled, resident or present here, or (3) because the relevant property is here.\n",
              "Such jurisdiction would not, as it seems to me at least, be exorbitant, nor would it offend the sovereignty of other States.\n",
              "That, however, is not what the statute can be made to say.\n",
              "What cannot, as it seems to me, be the correct construction is that, as SOCA was obliged to submit, it has jurisdiction to seek a (mandatory) civil recovery order over property in China which is the product of a crime committed in China by an offender who has never left that country.\n",
              "LORD JUDGE AND LORD CLARKE\n",
              "We will explain briefly why we are unable to agree with the conclusions of the majority of the Court that the appeal in relation to the worldwide property freezing order (PFO) should be allowed.\n",
              "We agree that the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (the Act) is poorly drafted.\n",
              "Nevertheless its objective is clear and can be explained in uncomplicated terms.\n",
              "Those who engage in criminal or unlawful conduct, whether here or abroad, should be deprived of the property which is or which represents the proceeds of their crimes or unlawful conduct.\n",
              "Part 2 of the Act addresses confiscation orders which may be made following convictions recorded in England and Wales.\n",
              "For these purposes section 84(1) provides: Property is all property wherever situated and includes (a) money; (b) all forms of real or personal property; (c) things in action and other intangible or incorporeal property.\n",
              "For present purposes, there are two crucial features.\n",
              "First, the property extends to all property including all forms of real or personal property and it applies to all such property wherever in the world it is situated.\n",
              "It was not suggested in the course of argument that, where these words appear in Part 2, they should be given a limited meaning.\n",
              "They mean what they say, that is, wherever in the world the property (whatever form it may take) is situated.\n",
              "Given the ease with which professional criminals in particular can move their assets around the world, by section 74 the Act unsurprisingly makes provision for the enforcement of confiscation orders abroad.\n",
              "It is an elementary principle of statutory construction that legislation in this country which purports to have effect abroad requires to be expressed in unequivocal language.\n",
              "Sovereign states are sovereign.\n",
              "We do not interfere in the affairs of a sovereign country in order to enforce orders made here which impact on people living and property located abroad.\n",
              "Accordingly, the provisions relating to the enforcement abroad of a confiscation order made here are structured so as to give full recognition to these principles, and the structures created for these purposes have not been called into question.\n",
              "Part 5 of the Act is concerned with the recovery of the proceeds of unlawful conduct when there is no criminal conviction in this jurisdiction.\n",
              "It applies to conduct which is unlawful within the United Kingdom or conduct which would be criminal abroad and which would be recognised as criminal here.\n",
              "Among its other wide ranging effects, it provides the statutory process by which those convicted of crimes abroad (including citizens of the relevant country) may be deprived of the proceeds or profits which have found their way into this country.\n",
              "Where the statutory conditions are satisfied the court is required to make a civil recovery order: by contrast, the effect of the order is that the enforcement authority is enabled to take the appropriate steps to enforce it.\n",
              "For the purposes of a civil recovery order under Part 5, property is identified in identical terms to the property which may be made the subject of the confiscation processes in Part 2 of the Act.\n",
              "An almost identical definition of property to that in section 84(1) is contained in Parts 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 11 of the Act.\n",
              "Section 316 is the general interpretation section for the purposes of Part 5.\n",
              "Section 316(2) provides that the following provisions apply for the purposes of Part 5.\n",
              "Those provisions include section 316(4), which provides: Property is all property wherever situated and includes (a) money, (b) all forms of property, real or personal, heritable or moveable, (c) things in action and other intangible or incorporeal property.\n",
              "It can be seen that the language is the same as that in section 84, save that it expressly includes language referable to Scottish property.\n",
              "In our judgment the expression all property wherever situated must have the same meaning in each of the sections in which it appears, including section 316(4).\n",
              "With respect to those who take a contrary view, it seems to us that the language unequivocally describes not only the whereabouts of the property encompassed within Part 5, but also the nature and type of property covered by it.\n",
              "This does not mean that absolutely every provision in the Act which refers to property must be taken as a reference to property wherever situated because it might be clear from the particular provision that it must be more limited.\n",
              "A good example is section 45(1) which is referred to in paras 14 and 35 above.\n",
              "It confers on a constable the power to seize property to prevent its removal from England and Wales.\n",
              "Since the power only arises in the case of property in England and Wales, it cannot refer to property wherever situated.\n",
              "Subject to such cases, the definition sections are of general effect.\n",
              "Until Mr James Eadie QC addressed the problems to which this appeal has given rise, we suspect that the extent of the control mechanisms built into the statutory processes had not been fully appreciated.\n",
              "However, as it seems to us, a civil recovery order in relation to property situated outside the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom is not designed to have extra territorial effect in the sense that it should operate so as to oblige a court or authority in a foreign country, or for that matter anyone living in that country, to obey the order.\n",
              "That would contravene the sovereignty principle.\n",
              "Indeed, if the enforcement authorities or the trustee for civil recovery were to barge into a foreign country demanding the return of property situated there on the basis of a civil recovery order made here, the response would almost certainly be decidedly cold, and ultimately ineffective.\n",
              "On the other hand, when properly informed that a court in this jurisdiction has made such an order, the authorities abroad would be likely to appreciate that there is or may be property within its jurisdiction which represents the proceeds of unlawful conduct and that, in accordance with their own procedures, this might, with advantage, be removed from the criminal, and dealt with in accordance with domestic principles within its own jurisdiction.\n",
              "In this way the criminal would be deprived of the proceeds and profits of crime or unlawful conduct.\n",
              "Notwithstanding the requirement on the court here to make a recovery order if satisfied that the necessary conditions are satisfied, we believe that control mechanisms have been created within Part 5 to ensure that the order may be made subject to appropriate conditions which would avoid any improper extra territorial effect or infringement of the principle of sovereignty.\n",
              "In the language of section 266(8) the order may address the manner in which the trustee for civil recovery may deal with any property vested by the order for the purpose of realising it.\n",
              "Section 267(5) acknowledges that the obligation on the trustee to maximise the amount payable to the enforcement authority must be realised only so far as practicable.\n",
              "The powers of the trustee under Schedule 7 extend to starting or continuing legal proceedings in relation to property, that is, property wherever situated.\n",
              "In our judgment this provides the trustee with the power to do so where the property is situated abroad.\n",
              "If so, any such proceedings would be governed by the legal structures which obtain in the relevant foreign country.\n",
              "Mr Eadie accepted in argument that the exercise of the functions of the trustee for civil recovery specified in section 267 of and Schedule 7 to the Act are subject to the powers of our court to impose conditions in relation to the recovery process which acknowledge the sovereignty principle and give effect to it.\n",
              "We agree.\n",
              "Some reliance was placed on section 269.\n",
              "However, in our opinion section 269 is directed only to the courts of England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland as the case might be.\n",
              "It tells those courts which legal rights must take priority over a recovery order.\n",
              "These may include rights under provisions of foreign law, where those provisions of foreign law are applicable under English conflicts rules.\n",
              "However section 269 does not purport to tell foreign courts what rules they may or may not apply.\n",
              "It therefore respects the principle of sovereignty.\n",
              "Section 243 provides that the enforcement authority must serve the claim form on the respondent wherever domiciled, resident or present.\n",
              "The parties agreed that it was not necessary to obtain permission to serve the claim form out of the jurisdiction on the basis that this is a claim which the court has power to determine within CPR 6.33(3).\n",
              "We assume for present purposes (without deciding) that that is correct.\n",
              "The claim form must then be served in accordance with CPR 6.40, which includes safeguards and, at any rate in many cases, requires service in accordance with the local law.\n",
              "In short, in relation to property situated abroad, to which Part 5 applies, we believe that it is open to the court making a civil recovery order to direct that any attempt to enforce the order abroad should not be made, save and except through the legal processes which obtain in the country where the property is situated, or in accordance with the procedures which apply to the enforcement of a confiscation order abroad, or subject to any other appropriate conditions.\n",
              "Viewed in this way, Part 5 of the Act is not inconsistent with and does not contravene the sovereignty principle.\n",
              "We recognise that the Strasbourg Convention does not expressly authorise proceedings of this kind but there is nothing in it which prohibits them.\n",
              "There is in our opinion nothing in the scheme or language of the Act which supports the conclusion that Part 5 is limited to property within the jurisdiction.\n",
              "Indeed section 286 shows that it was not so restricted.\n",
              "Section 286 is part of a series of sections entitled Miscellaneous and is itself entitled Scope of powers (Scotland).\n",
              "It provides: (1) Orders under this Chapter may be made by the Court of Session in respect of a person wherever domiciled, resident or present. (2) Such an order may be made by the Court of Session in respect of moveable property wherever situated. (3) But such an order in respect of a persons moveable property may not be made by the Court of Session where (a) the person is not domiciled, resident or present in Scotland, and (b) the property is not situated in Scotland, unless the unlawful conduct took place in Scotland.\n",
              "The section thus provides for the making of a recovery order where the relevant person is not domiciled, resident or present in Scotland and where the property is not situated in Scotland.\n",
              "The view expressed by the majority is inconsistent with that section, which (whether or not it is an enigma) is part of the Act.\n",
              "It is true that the section does require that in such circumstances a recovery order can only be made where the unlawful conduct took place in Scotland but that is not relevant to the question which divides the court, which is whether Part 5 applies to property outside the jurisdiction.\n",
              "Section 286 also provides assistance on the true construction of section 316(4).\n",
              "The expression wherever domiciled, resident or present in section 286(1) plainly means wherever situated in the world and the expression in respect of moveable property wherever situated in section 286(2) equally plainly means wherever the moveable property is situated in the world.\n",
              "The contrary is not suggested.\n",
              "In our judgment, there is no escape from the conclusion that wherever situated in section 316(4) means the same.\n",
              "It follows that, if, as the majority say at para 44, the question raised by the PFO appeal is whether the totality of Part 5 relates exclusively to property within the United Kingdom, the question must be answered in the negative.\n",
              "That conclusion seems to us to be supported by the scheme of Part 5.\n",
              "The general purpose of Part 5 is set out in section 240, which is defined in section 240(1) as for the purposes of enabling the enforcement authority to recover, in civil proceedings before the High Court or Court of Session, property which is, or represents, property obtained through unlawful conduct.\n",
              "The majority recognise that the second reference to property in that subsection must be to property wherever situated because section 241(2) makes it clear that unlawful conduct includes conduct which takes place outside the United Kingdom provided that it is unlawful in the place where it occurs and would be unlawful if it took place in the United Kingdom.\n",
              "There is nothing in section 240(1) which supports the conclusion that property where it is first used is to have a different meaning from property in the same section.\n",
              "Indeed, read naturally, it has the same meaning.\n",
              "The section provides for a recovery order to recover property which is property obtained through unlawful conduct.\n",
              "Given that it is agreed that property obtained through unlawful conduct can be property outside the jurisdiction, it must follow that property which is such property can be property outside the jurisdiction.\n",
              "The plain effect of section 240(1) read together with the definition section in section 316(4), which by section 316(2) applies for the purposes of Part 5, is that both references to property are references to property wherever situated.\n",
              "So too, as is accepted, are the references to obtaining property by unlawful conduct in section 242.\n",
              "This conclusion does not depend upon section 286 but is supported by it because it provides a particular example of a case where a recovery order may be made in respect of property outside the jurisdiction.\n",
              "So far as moveable property is concerned, the position in Scotland is clear.\n",
              "Section 286 shows that it includes moveable property anywhere in the world.\n",
              "It does not however apply in England.\n",
              "The provisions which apply in England are not limited in any relevant respect.\n",
              "As already stated, the definitions of property as being wherever situated in sections 84(1) in Part 2 and section 316(4) in Part 5 are part of the central provisions of those Parts.\n",
              "Moreover, section 240(2) provides that the powers conferred by Part 5 are exercisable in relation to any property regardless of whether any proceedings have been brought for an offence in connection with the property.\n",
              "Section 266(1) provides that If in proceedings under this Chapter the court is satisfied that any property is recoverable, the court must make a recovery order.\n",
              "By section 304(1) property obtained through unlawful conduct is recoverable property.\n",
              "It follows that (subject to the exceptions in section 308), recoverable property is a very wide term.\n",
              "It thus appears to us that property in section 266(1) is the property defined in section 316(4), which is all property wherever situated in the world.\n",
              "It was submitted that, by reason of the principles of international sovereignty, property situated abroad must be excluded because of section 266(2), which provides that the recovery order must vest the recoverable property in the trustee for civil recovery.\n",
              "We have already expressed our view that those principles are not infringed merely by including foreign property in the order because the order would be subject to the local law or lex situs.\n",
              "The problem is said to arise from the use of the word vest in section 266(2).\n",
              "There are two reasons why in our view there is no such problem.\n",
              "The first is that the majority accept that the expression moveable property wherever situated in section 286(2) means wherever situated in the world.\n",
              "In cases falling outside the restriction imposed by section 286(3), the majority therefore accept that moveable property situated anywhere in the world may be made the subject of a recovery order.\n",
              "Indeed, it must be made the subject of a recovery order under section 266(1) if the other criteria are satisfied.\n",
              "It follows that the majority see no problem with the making of an order in Scottish proceedings which vests moveable property which is outside the jurisdiction in the trustee for civil recovery.\n",
              "This is no doubt because, as explained above, any such order must be subject to the provisions of the local law and may be subject to appropriate conditions under section 266(8).\n",
              "Moreover, under section 267(5) the trustees obligation to sell the property is expressly limited by what is practicable.\n",
              "If there are no problems with applying section 266(1) and (2) to moveable property in the case of orders made by the Scottish courts, it follows that there are no problems in applying them to moveable property in the case of orders made by the English courts.\n",
              "The only difference between the jurisdiction of the two courts, so far as moveable property is concerned, is that the Scottish courts cannot make an order if the restriction imposed by section 286(3) is satisfied, whereas the jurisdiction of the English courts is not limited in the same way.\n",
              "The second reason why the use of the word vest does not gives rise to a difficulty is that it is capable of operating in personam.\n",
              "Mr Eadie relies upon the similar use of the verb vests in section 306(1) of the Insolvency Act 1986, which provides that a bankrupts estate shall vest in the trustee immediately upon his appointment taking effect.\n",
              "He relies upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ashurst v Pollard [2001] Ch 595, which related to real property in Portugal which was owned by the bankrupt and his wife.\n",
              "Jonathan Parker LJ (with whom Kennedy and Potter LJJ agreed) said at para 11 that the vesting provisions of section 306 cannot effect a change in the Portuguese register of title, which continues to record Mr and Mrs Pollard as the joint owners of the property.\n",
              "Thus in those circumstances, as here, the mere making of a vesting order does not have the inevitable consequence of transferring the legal interest in (or legal title to) real property to the trustee in bankruptcy or (here) the trustee for civil recovery.\n",
              "We would accept Mr Eadies submission that the consequences of a vesting order in relation to property situate abroad depend upon the local law or lex situs.\n",
              "We recognise that there are differences between the Insolvency Act and the Act but in our opinion the Insolvency Act provides a valuable pointer to the correct conclusion under Part 5 of the Act, namely that, as Tomlinson LJ concisely put it in the Court of Appeal at para 168, vest is simply an ordinary English word which takes its meaning from its context and is not here used as a term of art which carries with it inevitable consequences as to the effective transfer of title.\n",
              "In these circumstances, given the fact that section 266 must be construed so that it does not offend against the principles of sovereignty in international law, we see no difficulty in applying it to orders relating to moveable property made by the English courts.\n",
              "What then of immoveable property? Again, we see no reason in either the language of the Act or the principles of international law to prohibit a recovery order in such a case.\n",
              "The effectiveness of such an order would simply be subject to the rules of the lex situs.\n",
              "The definition of property in sections 84(1) and 316(4) expressly applies to all forms of property including real property wherever situated.\n",
              "It thus applies on its face to real property outside the United Kingdom and, whatever the position in Scotland in the light of section 286(2), the Act gives the English courts jurisdiction to make a recovery order in respect of such real property.\n",
              "The provisions of Part 5 of the Act, at any rate in relation to proceedings in England and Wales, are in our view unequivocal.\n",
              "They plainly apply to all property, whether real or personal and wherever situated in the world.\n",
              "Moreover they reflect the purpose behind the Act, namely to deprive criminals of their ill gotten gains.\n",
              "We recognise that how effective the approach we favour will be depends upon the co operation of courts elsewhere.\n",
              "However, for the reasons we have given, we are firmly of the view that nothing we have said infringes or would infringe the sovereignty of other states or the principles of international law.\n",
              "We prefer the views of Mitting J at first instance and of Maurice Kay, Hooper and Tomlinson LJJ in the Court of Appeal to those of the majority.\n",
              "For these reasons we would dismiss the PFO appeal.\n",
              "As to the disclosure order (DO) appeal, we agree that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by Lord Phillips in para 94 above.\n",
              "There is nothing in section 357 or 358 to indicate that it was intended that a notice under a disclosure order could be given to a person outside the jurisdiction.\n",
              "The position under section 357 is not inconsistent with our analysis of Part 5.\n",
              "A core feature of our analysis of Part 5 is that recovery orders take effect in personam subject to the local law, or lex situs.\n",
              "In other words, they have no legal consequences outside the United Kingdom except those positively prescribed by local law.\n",
              "For this reason, recovery orders do not impinge upon the sovereignty of foreign states.\n",
              "By contrast, an information notice given to someone outside the United Kingdom has the potential to criminalise acts and omissions committed abroad by foreign citizens who are outside the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom courts.\n",
              "There is no scope for reading the relevant provisions of Part 8 as taking effect subject to the local law or lex situs.\n",
              "The statutory language is clear and unequivocal unless the recipient of an information notice has a reasonable excuse he is guilty of an offence if he fails to comply with an information notice.\n",
              "Further, Part 5 clearly contemplates service on persons anywhere in the world.\n",
              "Section 243(2) states that the claim form must be served on the respondent wherever domiciled, resident or present.\n",
              "If Parliament intended SOCA to have authority to give information notices anywhere in the world, one would expect to see an equivalent provision in Part 8.\n",
              "However Part 8 contains no such provision.\n",
              "Section 357(4) defines a disclosure order as an order authorising SOCA to give information notices to any person the appropriate officer considers has relevant information.\n",
              "There is nothing in this language to suggest that SOCAs power may be exercised extra territorially.\n",
              "In addition, paragraph 15 of Practice Direction Civil Recovery Proceedings states: Disclosure order 15.1 The application notice should normally name as respondents the persons on whom the appropriate officer intends to serve notices under the disclosure order sought. 15.2 A disclosure order must (1) give an indication of the nature of the investigation for the purposes of which the order is made; (2) set out the action which the order authorises the appropriate officer to take in accordance with section 357(4) of the Act; (3) contain a statement of (a) the offences relating to disclosure orders under section 359 of the Act; and (b) the right of any person affected by the order to apply to discharge or vary the order. 15.3 Where, pursuant to a disclosure order, the appropriate officer gives to any person a notice under section 357(4) of the Act, he must also at the same time serve on that person a copy of the disclosure order.\n",
              "Paragraph 15.3 suggests that the recipient of an information notice is not obliged to comply with the notice unless and until SOCA serves a copy of the disclosure order on him.\n",
              "Presumably, that service must take place in accordance with the CPR.\n",
              "However it is not at all clear by what mechanism under the CPR SOCA could serve a copy of a disclosure order on a person outside the United Kingdom.\n",
              "This reinforces the view that information notices can only be served on persons who are physically present within the United Kingdom.\n",
              "We agree that the appropriate relief is a declaration that the DO does not authorise sending information notices to persons who are outside the United Kingdom.</td>\n",

              "The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) is now seeking to deprive Mr Perry, together with members of his family and entities associated with them, of assets obtained in connection with his criminal conduct, wherever in the world those assets may be situated.\n",
              "None of these persons resides in the United Kingdom.\n",
              "As a preliminary step, aimed at ensuring that its action to recover assets is effective, SOCA obtained a worldwide property freezing order (PFO) against Mr Perry, his wife and Leadenhall Property Limited (the PFO appellants).\n",
              "Before that, it had obtained a disclosure order (DO) under which notices requesting information were given to Mr Perry and his daughters (the DO appellants) by letter addressed to Mr Perrys house in London.\n",
              "The PFO appellants challenged the PFO on the basis that a civil recovery order could only be made in respect of property that was within the territorial jurisdiction of the court making it.\n",
              "The DO appellants contended that notices under the DO could not be addressed to persons who were not within the UK.\n",
              "In the PFO matter, the High Court ruled that the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA) relied on by SOCA did apply, save as to orders made in Scotland, to property outside the jurisdiction and upheld the scope of the PFO.\n",
              "An appeal from this decision was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 18 May 2011.\n",
              "Earlier, the Court of Appeal had also upheld the validity of the notices requesting information given to the DO appellants under the DO.\n",
              "Appeals against the PFO and the DO notices were brought to the Supreme Court and were heard together.\n",
              "The Supreme Court allows both appeals: the PFO appeal by a majority (Lord Judge and Lord Clarke dissenting) and the DO appeal unanimously.\n",
              "Lord Phillips (with whom Lady Hale, Lord Brown, Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson agree) gives the main judgment.\n",
              "Lord Reed and Sir Anthony Hughes give shorter concurring judgments.\n",
              "Lord Judge and Lord Clarke give a joint dissenting judgment on the PFO appeal.\n",
              "SOCAs application was pursuant to the powers in Part 5 of POCA for the court to make a civil recovery order in respect of property which is, or represents, property obtained through criminal conduct.\n",
              "The applicable definition of the term property is in section 316(4) which provides that property is all property wherever situated.\n",
              "However, many of the provisions referring to property in POCA plainly apply only to property within the UK and the scope of the term depends on its context.\n",
              "Thus the definition should not have been given the weight it had carried in the courts below [14].\n",
              "Although there was a presumption under principles of international law that a statute does not have extraterritorial effect, states have departed from this by agreement in the case of confiscating the proceeds of crime.\n",
              "POCA must be read in the light of the Strasbourg Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime, which recognises that the courts of state A may seek to seize property in state B which is the proceeds of the criminal conduct of a defendant subject to the criminal jurisdiction of state A [18 29].\n",
              "Parts 2, 3 and 4 of POCA provide for (a) the imposition of personal obligations in respect of property worldwide; (b) proprietary measures to secure and realise property within the UK and (c) requests to be made to other states to take such measures in respect of property within their territories.\n",
              "This represents a coherent international scheme which accords with the Strasbourg Convention and with principles of international law [31 38].\n",
              "The purpose of Part 5 of POCA is to enable recovery in civil proceedings in each part of the UK of property which is or represents property obtained through unlawful conduct.\n",
              "The focus is on the property rather than a particular defendant.\n",
              "In their natural meaning, and in the absence of provisions corresponding to those for enforcement abroad in Parts 2, 3 and 4, the provisions of Part 5 apply only to property within the UK [53 56, 136].\n",
              "The only anomaly with this analysis was the presence of section 286(2) POCA which purported to create a different position in Scotland from that in the rest of the UK.\n",
              "There was no satisfactory explanation for this and it remained an enigma [75 77] (Lord Reed thought it may have reflected a misunderstanding [152]), but it did not alter the overall conclusion that the High Court of England and Wales had no jurisdiction under Part 5 to make a recovery order in relation to property outside England and Wales.\n",
              "Thus the property covered by the PFO must be limited to such property, and the appellants could not be required under it to disclose all their worldwide assets [78 82].\n",
              "The notices under the DO were given to persons who were, and were known by SOCA to be, outside the jurisdiction of the UK.\n",
              "Compliance with such orders was subject to penal sanction.\n",
              "It was generally contrary to international law for country A to purport to make criminal conduct in country B committed by persons who are not citizens of country A.\n",
              "It was therefore implicit that the power to impose positive obligations to provide information could only be exercised in respect of persons who were within the UK and the DO did not authorise the sending of notices to persons outside the UK [94, 98].\n",
              "Lord Judge and Lord Clarke, dissenting on the PFO appeal, agreed that POCA was poorly drafted but held that the objective was clearly to deprive criminals of the proceeds of their crimes, whether here or abroad [160].\n",
              "The expression all property wherever situated should have the same meaning in all sections in which it appeared [164].\n",
              "Control mechanisms had been created in Part 5 to ensure that orders made could avoid any improper extra territorial effect or infringement of the principle of sovereignty.\n",
              "Recovery orders took personal effect and, in respect of foreign property, were subject to the local law [167].</td>\n",

              "Their part of the councils undertaking was then contracted out to a private sector employer named CCL Ltd and they were transferred into its employment.\n",
              "In May 2004 CCLs undertaking was taken over by another private sector employer named Parkwood Leisure Ltd (Parkwood), which is the respondent to this appeal.\n",
              "As a result of that transfer the appellants became employees of Parkwood.\n",
              "The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 (SI 1981/1794) (TUPE) applied to each of these transfers.\n",
              "TUPE safeguards the rights of employees when the business in which they worked changes hands between employers.\n",
              "It preserves their contractual rights so that they are enforceable against the transferee after the transfer.\n",
              "Regulations 5(1) and 5(2) of TUPE provided that their contracts of employment were to have effect after the transfer as if originally made between the persons so employed and the transferee.\n",
              "TUPE was replaced by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/246) which came into force on 5 April 2006.\n",
              "But the transfers with which this case is concerned took place before that date.\n",
              "So the position that applies to them is governed by the 1981 Regulations, which I shall continue to refer to as TUPE.\n",
              "The council subscribed to the National Joint Council for Local Government Services (the NJC).\n",
              "The NJC comprises within its membership representatives of local authority employers and trades unions.\n",
              "As the appellants were employees of a local authority, their contracts of employment with the council included a term which entitled them to the benefit of the terms and conditions set by the NJC.\n",
              "They were in a standard form which, under the heading Terms and Conditions of Employment, contained the following express term: During your employment with the council your terms and conditions of employment will be in accordance with collective agreements negotiated from time to time by the National Joint Council for Local Government Services, set out in the scheme of conditions of service (commonly known as the Green Book) supplemented by agreements reached locally through the councils negotiating committees.\n",
              "Among the terms and conditions collectively agreed by the NJC were rates of pay for employees of local authorities.\n",
              "At the date of the appellants transfer to CCL there were in place collectively agreed terms setting out the pay rates for the period from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2004.\n",
              "Those terms were honoured by CCL throughout the period of the appellants employment with that company.\n",
              "In March 2004 NJC negotiations began for the period from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2007.\n",
              "There were twelve representations of the local government associations on the NJC and various unions, including UNISON of which the appellants were members.\n",
              "But Parkwood does not recognise UNISON and, as it is a private sector employer, it cannot belong to the NJC or be represented on it.\n",
              "So it was not a party to these negotiations.\n",
              "The negotiations concluded on 4 June 2004, after the date of Parkwoods takeover of CCL.\n",
              "On 14 July 2004 the NJC issued a circular summarising the three year settlement.\n",
              "It included pay increases for the periods from 1 April 2004 and 1 April 2005.\n",
              "Parkwood initially refused to award the appellants pay increases in accordance with the collective agreement for the periods from 1 April 2004 and 1 April 2005.\n",
              "The appellants brought claims against it for unauthorised deductions from their wages contrary to section 13 of the Employment Rights Act 1996.\n",
              "These claims were settled without admission of liability and the increases for these years were paid.\n",
              "But Parkwood declined to award the appellants increased rates of pay in accordance with the collective agreements with effect from 1 April 2006 and 1 April 2007.\n",
              "So the appellants brought further claims against Parkwood for unauthorised deductions in the London (South) Employment Tribunal (the ET).\n",
              "The ET dismissed their claims, for reasons that were given in a judgment sent to the parties on 16 July 2008.\n",
              "On 12 January 2009 the Employment Appeal Tribunal (the EAT), allowed the appellants appeal against that decision and remitted the claims to the ET for a hearing as to remedy: [2009] ICR 703.\n",
              "Parkwood was given permission to appeal.\n",
              "On 29 January 2010 the Court of Appeal (Ward, Smith and Rimer LJJ) allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the EAT and restored the decision of the ET to dismiss the appellants claims: [2010] EWCA Civ 24, [2010] ICR 793.\n",
              "The issues\n",
              "The issue which lies at the heart of this appeal is whether the effect of regulations 5(1) and 5(2) of TUPE is that the appellants are entitled to the benefit of increases in pay negotiated by the NJC after they were transferred into the employment of Parkwood.\n",
              "It is common ground that, had this issue been solely one of domestic law, the question would have been open only to one answer.\n",
              "In BET Catering Services Ltd v Ball (unreported) 28 November 1996, Lindsay J, delivering the judgment of the appeal tribunal in Mrs Balls favour, said that he could see no conceptual difficulty in a private sector employer binding itself to public sector pay rates.\n",
              "In Whent v T Cartledge Ltd [1997] IRLR 153, in a judgment delivered by Judge Hicks QC, the appeal tribunal said that, once it was accepted that regulation 5 of TUPE applied and that there had been no relevant subsequent variation in the contract of employment, the issue became simply one of the true meaning of the clause that provided that the employees pay would be in accordance with the agreement made by the NJC as amended from time to time, and that there was no apparent reason why the transfer should cause any change in the meaning of these words: para 9.\n",
              "The employment tribunals view that it could not be right that an employer is bound ad infinitum by the terms of a succession of collective agreements negotiated by bodies other than themselves was rejected.\n",
              "In para 16 Judge Hicks said: there is simply no reason why parties should not, if they choose, agree that matters such as remuneration be fixed by processes in which they do not themselves participate.\n",
              "In Glendale Grounds Management v Bradley, (unreported) 19 February 1998, and Glendale Managed Services v Graham [2003] EWCA Civ 773, [2003] IRLR 465 issues were raised as to whether a different result followed because of particular words used in the employees contract.\n",
              "In Bradley it was held that the particular terms of the contract required the approval of the employer for the time being to any new negotiated terms, whereas Glendale had given none.\n",
              "In Graham the clause provided that the rate of remuneration would normally be in accordance with the NJC.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal held that it was an implied term of that contract that the employer must inform the employee if and when there was to be a departure from the normal situation.\n",
              "BET Catering Services Ltd v Ball and Whent v T Cartledge Ltd were not referred to.\n",
              "But I agree with Rimer LJs observation in the Court of Appeal in this case that the decision in Graham was impliedly consistent with the approach that was reflected in those cases: [2010] ICR 793, para 21.\n",
              "The view that was taken in those decisions about the effect of conditions of the kind that the appellants rely on in this case was, in my opinion, entirely consistent with the common law principle of freedom of contract.\n",
              "There can be no objection in principle to parties including a term in their contract that the employees pay is to be determined from time to time by a third party such as the NJC of which the employer is not a member or on which it is not represented.\n",
              "It all depends on what the parties have agreed to, as revealed by the words they have used in their contract.\n",
              "The fact that the employer has no part to play in the negotiations by which the rates of pay are determined makes no difference.\n",
              "Unless the contract itself provides otherwise, the employee is entitled to be paid according to the rates of pay as determined by the third party.\n",
              "This is simply what the parties have agreed to in their contract.\n",
              "The same is true of the transferee in the event of the transfer of an undertaking regulated by TUPE.\n",
              "Domestic law tells us that the term in the contract is enforceable against the transferee in just the same way as it was against the original employer.\n",
              "As Rimer LJ said in the Court of Appeal, decisions such as Whent amount to no more than a conventional application of ordinary principles of contract law to the statutory consequences apparently created by regulation 5 of TUPE: [2010] ICR 793, para 46.\n",
              "But the issue is not solely one of domestic law.\n",
              "Regulation 5 of TUPE must be read together with article 3(1) of Council Directive 77/187/EEC of 14 February 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses (OJ 1977 L61, p 26) (the Directive), to which it gave effect.\n",
              "The question that has brought the appeal before this court is whether the approach that has hitherto been taken as to the effect of TUPE can still stand, in the light of the decision of the European Court of Justice in Werhof v Freeway Traffic Systems GmbH & Co KG (Case C 499/04) [2006] ECR I 2397 (Werhof).\n",
              "The ECJ was concerned in that case with the meaning and effect of article 3(1) of the Directive.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal held that the decision of the ECJ in Werhof was to be understood as meaning that the transferee was not committed by article 3(1) to any collective agreement made after the expiry of an agreement that was in force at the date of the transfer, and that there was nothing in the language of regulation 5 of TUPE to indicate that it was intended to enlarge employees rights beyond those provided for by article 3(1).\n",
              "Its conclusion was that, in the light of Werhof, the domestic decisions in cases such as Whent were wrong and should not be followed.\n",
              "The appellants contend for what has been described as a dynamic interpretation of the effect of their contract on transferees.\n",
              "That is to say, that their contracts should be given effect according to their terms, binding the transferee to give effect to collective agreements negotiated by the NJC from time to time in the same way as if they had still been employed by the council.\n",
              "The respondents submit that the effect of Werhof is that static rights only are protected, with the result that the transferee is not bound by any collective agreements that were not already binding on the original employer on the date of the transfer.\n",
              "The questions that must be examined, therefore, are these: (i) what is the effect of the judgment of the Court of Justice in Werhof as to the interpretation of article 3(1) of the Directive? (ii) to what extent, if at all, is there room for giving a different meaning to regulation 5 of TUPE in domestic law from that indicated by Werhof as to the meaning of article 3(1)?\n",
              "The legislation\n",
              "As Rimer LJ observed in para 9 of his judgment, the law in the United Kingdom prior to the bringing into force of legislation to comply with the Directive was that, if an employer transferred his business to another, the employees contracts of employment were terminated.\n",
              "It was a matter entirely for the transferee to decide whether it should continue to employ the employees of the transferor in the business which it had acquired and, if so, on what terms.\n",
              "That position was reversed by the implementation of the Directive in 1981 by TUPE.\n",
              "The position now is that the rights of employees when the business in which they worked changes hands between employers are safeguarded.\n",
              "The extent to which their contractual rights are protected so that they are enforceable against the transferee after the transfer has not hitherto been in question.\n",
              "The 1977 Directive was amended by Council Directive 98/50/EC (OJ 1998 L201, p 88).\n",
              "Article 3 of the amended version reproduced in substance the provisions of article 3 of the 1977 Directive, as the ECJ noted in Werhof, para 4.\n",
              "Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 (OJ 2001 L82, p 16) has replaced the 1977 Directive, but the tenor of the wording used in the article 3 of the 1998 Directive has been retained: Werhof, in the opinion of Advocate General Ruiz Jarabo Colomer, para 9.\n",
              "As both the Advocate General and the Court of Justice directed their attention to the wording of the 1977 Directive in Werhof, and as that was the Directive that TUPE was intended to implement, I shall do the same for the purposes of this judgment.\n",
              "The preamble to the Directive included the following recitals : Whereas it is necessary to provide for the protection of employees in the event of a change of employer, in particular, to ensure that their rights are safeguarded; Whereas differences still remain in the Member States as regards the extent of the protection of employees in this respect and these difference should be reduced; Whereas these differences can have a direct effect on the functioning of the common market; Whereas it is therefore necessary to promote the approximation of laws in this field .\n",
              "No mention was made in the recitals of any need to protect employers in the event of a change in employer as against the rights that were to be safeguarded for the protection of the employees.\n",
              "In article 1(1) of the Directive it was declared that the Directive was to apply to the transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business to another employer as a result of a legal transfer or merger.\n",
              "Article 3 of the Directive included these provisions: 1.The transferors rights and obligations arising from a contract of employment or from an employment relationship existing on the date of a transfer within the meaning of article 1(1) shall, by reason of such transfer, be transferred to the transferee.\n",
              "Member States may provide that, after the date of the transfer within the meaning of article 1(1) and in addition to the transferee, the transferor shall continue to be liable in respect of obligations which arose from a contract of employment or an employment relationship. 2.\n",
              "Following the transfer within the meaning of article 1(1), the transferee shall continue to observe the terms and conditions agreed in any collective agreement on the same terms applicable to the transferor under that agreement, until the date of termination or expiry of the collective agreement or the entry into force or application of another collective agreement.\n",
              "Member States may limit the period for observing such terms and conditions, with the proviso that it shall not be less than one year.\n",
              "As the aim of the Directive was the approximation of the laws of the Member States, not their harmonisation, article 7 of the Directive provided: This Directive shall not affect the right of member states to apply or introduce laws, regulations or administrative provisions which are more favourable to employees.\n",
              "In that connection it should be noted that the Directive did not apply to sea going vessels: article 1(3).\n",
              "Nor, according to consistent decisions of the Court of Justice, did it apply to transfers of undertakings in the context of insolvency proceedings unless the undertaking had continued to trade or was expected to continue to trade: see Transport and General Workers Union v Swissport (UK) Ltd (in administration) and another [2007] ICR 1593, paras 56 58.\n",
              "TUPE was made under the authority of section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972, subsection (2) of which, as amended by section 27(1) of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006, provides inter alia that at any time after the passing of that Act any designated Minister or department may by order, rules, regulations or scheme make provision for the purpose of implementing any EU obligation of the United Kingdom or enabling any such obligation to be implemented.\n",
              "Paragraphs (1) and (2) of Regulation 5 of TUPE, as amended by section 33(4)(a) and (b) of the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993, provided: (1) Except where objection is made under paragraph (4A) below, a relevant transfer shall not operate so as to terminate the contract of employment of any person employed by the transferor in the undertaking or part transferred but any such contract which would otherwise have been terminated by the transfer shall have effect after the transfer as if originally made between the person so employed and the transferee. (2) Without prejudice to paragraph (1) above, but subject to paragraph (4A) below, on the completion of a relevant transfer (a) all the transferors rights, powers, duties and liabilities under or in connection with any such contract shall be transferred by virtue of this regulation to the transferee; and (b) anything done before the transfer is completed by or in relation to the transferor in respect of that contract or a person employed in that undertaking or part shall be deemed to have been done by or in relation to the transferee.\n",
              "A relevant transfer is a transfer to which TUPE applies, that is to say a transfer from one person to another of an undertaking situated immediately before the transfer in the United Kingdom: regulation 3, read with regulation 2(1).\n",
              "Regulation 5(4A), which was inserted by section 33(4)(c) of the 1993 Act, provided that paragraphs (1) and (2) were not to operate to transfer the employees contract of employment and the rights, powers, duties and liabilities under or in connection with it if he informs the transferor or the transferee that he objects to becoming employed by the transferee.\n",
              "Regulation 6 of TUPE was in these terms: Where at the time of a relevant transfer there exists a collective agreement made by or on behalf of the transferor with a trade union recognised by the transferor in respect of any employee whose contract of employment is preserved by regulation 5(1) above, then (a) without prejudice to section 18 of the 1974 Act or article 63 of the 1976 Order (collective agreements presumed to be unenforceable in specified circumstances) that agreement, in its application in relation to the employee, shall, after the transfer, have effect as if made by or on behalf of the transferee with that trade union, and accordingly anything done under or in connection with it, in its application as aforesaid, by or in relation to the transferor before the transfer, shall, after the transfer, be deemed to have been done by or in relation to the transferee; and (b) any order made in respect of that agreement, in its application in relation to the employee, shall, after the transfer, have effect as if the transferee were a party to the agreement.\n",
              "Section 18 of the 1974 Act is now to be found in section 179 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.\n",
              "The interpretative obligation in domestic law\n",
              "I shall deal with this question first so that the decision of the Court of Justice in Werhof [2006] ECR I 2397, which is the most troublesome aspect of this case, can be examined in the right context.\n",
              "The appellants submit that, even if the ruling in Werhof is inconsistent with the interpretation of regulation 5 of TUPE for which they contend, it does not warrant any reading down of regulation 5 given that article 7 of the Directive expressly authorises more generous protection for employees.\n",
              "The respondents, on the other hand, say that regulation 5 of TUPE was introduced to implement, and to do no more than implement, article 3 of the Directive and that, in that situation, the courts of the United Kingdom are obliged to construe the domestic legislation consistently with the Directive and rulings of the Court of Justice as to the meaning and scope of the Directive.\n",
              "As to the latter point, it is well established that it is the duty of the court to construe domestic legislation which has been enacted to give effect to the United Kingdoms obligations under the EU Treaty so as to conform to those obligations, so far as it is possible to do so.\n",
              "In Pickstone v Freemans plc [1989] AC 66 it was held that words were to be implied into a regulation which was designed to give effect to Council Directive 75/117/EEC dealing with equal pay for women doing work of equal value.\n",
              "This was because, if the House had not been able to make that implication, the United Kingdom would have been in breach of its treaty obligations to give effect to Directives.\n",
              "In Litster v Forth Dry Dock & Engineering Co Ltd [1990] 1 AC 546, where the employees had been dismissed a short time before the transfer became operative, the issue was as to the meaning of the words immediately before the transfer in regulation 5(3) of TUPE.\n",
              "Lord Keith of Kinkel said at p 554: it is the duty of the court to give to regulation 5 a construction which accords with the decisions of the European Court upon the corresponding provisions of the Directive to which the regulation was intended by Parliament to give effect.\n",
              "The precedent established by Pickstone v Freemans plc indicates that this is to be done by implying the words necessary to achieve that result.\n",
              "Lord Oliver of Aylmerton said at p 559: If the legislation can reasonably be construed so as to conform with those obligations obligations which are to be ascertained not only from the wording of the relevant Directive but from the interpretation placed upon it by the European Court of Justice at Luxembourg such a purposive construction will be applied even though, perhaps, it may involve some departure from the strict and literal application of the words which the legislature has elected to use.\n",
              "This approach is consistent with what the Court of Justice itself said in von Colson and Kamann v Land Nordrhein Westfalen (Case 14/83) [1984] ECR 1891 with regard to Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment (OJ 1976 L39, p 40).\n",
              "In para 26 the court said that: the member states obligation arising from a Directive to achieve the result envisaged by the Directive and their duty under article 5 of the Treaty to take all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure the fulfilment of that obligation, is binding on all the authorities of member states including, for matters within their jurisdiction, the courts.\n",
              "It follows that, in applying the national law and in particular the provisions of a national law specifically introduced in order to implement Directive 76/207, national courts are required to interpret their national law in the light of the wording and the purpose of the Directive in order to achieve the result referred to in the third paragraph of article 189.\n",
              "All of this is, of course, now very well known and it is common ground between the parties.\n",
              "Mr Linden QC for the appellants submitted, however, that there was no decision of the Court of Justice which prohibits the domestic court from doing other than applying its domestic law approach to interpretation in a case where there was no reason to be concerned that the domestic provisions fell short of what Community law requires.\n",
              "In R (Hurst) v London Northern District Coroner [2007] UKHL 13, [2007] 2 AC 189, para 52 Lord Brown of Eaton under Heywood said that the interpretative effect that Community law required was strictly confined to those case where, on their particular facts, the application of the domestic legislation in its ordinary meaning would produce a result incompatible with the relevant European Community legislation.\n",
              "In cases where no European Community rights would be infringed, the domestic legislation is to be construed and applied in the ordinary way.\n",
              "Mr Linden referred to two decisions of the Court of Justice that he said supported this approach to the construction of domestic legislation by national courts.\n",
              "They showed, he said, that it was open to national courts to adopt an interpretation of domestic legislation that had been designed to give effect to the result sought to be achieved by a Directive that was more favourable than that indicated by the Directive itself.\n",
              "In Katsikas v Konstantinidis (Joined Cases C 132/91, C 138/91 and C 139/91) [1992] ECR I 6577 the court was asked to consider a provision in article 613a(1) of the German Domestic Code which had been held by the German Labour Court to have the effect of preventing a transfer of the employment relationship where one of the employees had objected to the transfer of his employment by the business in which he was employed.\n",
              "Provisions to the same effect are now to be found in regulations 5(4A) and 5(4B) of TUPE.\n",
              "The question was whether the words laws, regulations or administrative provisions in article 7 of the Directive, which enable Member States to introduce laws which were more favourable to employees than the Directive, covered more favourable interpretations of measures of that kind given by national courts.\n",
              "The court said in paras 39 and 40 that it had been consistently held that the scope of national laws, regulations and administrative provisions had to be assessed having regard to the interpretation given to them by the national courts and that the expression used in article 7 must be understood as referring to those measures as they are interpreted by the courts of that state.\n",
              "In Criminal Proceedings against Lindqvist (Case C 101/01) [2004] QB 1014 questions had been referred to the Court of Justice as to whether Council Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data was compatible with the general principles of freedom of expression and whether national rules might be introduced that were more restrictive than the Community provisions.\n",
              "As to the first point, the court said in para 85 that it was at the stage of the application at national level of the legislation implementing the Directive in individual cases that a balance must be found between the rights and interests involved.\n",
              "The courts of the member states had to make sure, however, that they did not rely on an interpretation which would be in conflict with the fundamental principles protected by the Community legal order: para 87.\n",
              "In paras 97 98 it said: 97 It is true that Directive 95/46 allows the member states a margin for manoeuvre in certain areas and authorises them to maintain or introduce particular rules for specific situations, as a large number of its provisions demonstrate.\n",
              "However, such possibilities must be made use of in the manner provided for by Directive 95/46 and in accordance with its objective of maintaining a balance between the free movement of personal data and the protection of private life. 98 On the other hand, nothing prevents a member state from extending the scope of the national legislation implementing the provisions of Directive 95/46 to areas not included within the scope thereof, provided that no other provision of Community law precludes it.\n",
              "The question that these decisions give rise to are (1) whether regulations 5(1) and 5(2) of TUPE were designed to be more generous than article 3(1) of the Directive as interpreted by the Court of Justice in Werhof [2006] ECR I 2397, according to the respondents reading of that decision; and (2) if not, whether it is open to the national court to construe regulation 5 of TUPE more generously because to do so is not precluded by article 3(1).\n",
              "Was regulation 5 of TUPE designed to be more generous?\n",
              "There is no doubt that in some respects TUPE was more generous to employees than the Directive.\n",
              "As already noted (see para 16, above), the Directive did not apply to sea going vessels.\n",
              "In Castle View Services Ltd v Howes 2000 SLT 696, however, the First Division of the Court of Session held that the crews of such vessels were not excluded from the benefit of the regulations: see also NUMAST v P&O Scottish Ferries Ltd [2005] ICR 1270.\n",
              "In Transport and General Workers Union v Swissport (UK) Ltd (in administration) [2007] 1CR 1593 it was held that TUPE applied to transfers of undertakings in insolvency cases, whereas the Directive did not.\n",
              "TUPE did not adopt the one year maximum on the period for observing collective agreements after a transfer in regulation 6, as member states were authorised to do by the second paragraph of article 3(2).\n",
              "And regulations 5(4A) and 5(4B) introduced by section 33 of the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993, which enable employees to object to being transferred, are also more generous: Katsikas v Konstantinidis v Stauereibetreib Paetz [1992] ECR I 6577.\n",
              "It is not possible, however, to detect anything in regulations 5(1) and 5(2) of TUPE that is so obviously more generous than what is to be found in article 3(1) of the Directive.\n",
              "Regulation 5(1) does say something that article 3(1) does not say in so many words.\n",
              "This is that a relevant transfer shall not operate so as to terminate the contract of employment, which shall have effect after the transfer as if originally made between the employee and the transferee.\n",
              "Article 3(1) leaves this to implication, concentrating as it does on the fundamental point that the transferors rights and obligations arising from the contract shall, by reason of the transfer, be transferred to the transferee.\n",
              "This is the point that is picked up, admittedly in more elaborate language, in regulation 5(2)(a) and (b).\n",
              "The words rights and obligations are expanded to rights, powers, duties and liabilities.\n",
              "But the expanded phrase does not encompass anything more than was caught by the words used in article 3(1).\n",
              "So there is in substance no difference.\n",
              "Regulation 5(2)(b) goes on to refer to things done in relation to the transferor before the transfer, which are deemed to have been done by or in relation to the transferee.\n",
              "But here too we find an expanded description of what is already captured by the words rights and obligations in article 3(1).\n",
              "Mr Linden sought to find support for his argument as to the intention of Parliament from the fact that regulations 4(1) and (2) of the 2006 Regulations which came into force on 6 April 2006 were in almost the same terms as regulations 5(1) and (2) of TUPE.\n",
              "He submitted that, by re enacting the equivalent provisions of TUPE, Parliament must be taken to have endorsed the interpretation that had been given to those provisions in BET Catering Services Ltd v Ball and Whent v T Cartledge Ltd (see para 7, above).\n",
              "I do not think that it is open to us to make that assumption.\n",
              "No reference to these authorities was made in the Public Consultation Document issued by the Employment Relations Directorate of the Department of Trade and Industry in March 2005 and none of the questions that were asked were addressed to this point.\n",
              "Furthermore, by the time the 2006 Regulations were laid before Parliament on 7 February 2006 the Advocate Generals opinion in Werhof [2006] ECR I 2397 was in the public domain.\n",
              "It was delivered on 15 November 2005, so anyone who was keeping an eye on what was being said about the effect of article 3(1) of the Directive would have been aware of the raising of the issue as to its limits by that time.\n",
              "The judgment in Werhof was promulgated on 9 March 2006, and the 2006 Regulations came into force on 6 April 2006.\n",
              "This timetable indicates that it would not be safe to infer that Parliaments intention was to do anything more than simply to give continuing effect to the Directive.\n",
              "I think therefore that Rimer LJ summarised the situation correctly when he said that it seemed to him that the language of regulations 5(1) and (2) of TUPE sat harmoniously with that of article 3(1) and gave effect to it: [2010] ICR 793, para 56.\n",
              "In my opinion Parliament must be taken to have intended to do no more, when it was enacting regulations 5(1) and (2), than implement article 3(1) of the Directive.\n",
              "The same must be said of its intention when it was enacting the 2006 Regulations.\n",
              "Is it open to the national court to interpret regulation 5 more generously?\n",
              "I address this question on the assumption, whose soundness I will examine later, that the effect of the decision of the Court of Justice in Werhof [2006] ECR I 2397 is that the transfer of dynamic contractual rights was inconsistent with article 3(1) of the Directive.\n",
              "It seems to me that Mr Lindens argument that it is open to the domestic courts to give regulations 5(1) and 5(2) of TUPE their ordinary meaning derives some support from what the Court of Justice said in the cases of Katsikas v Konstantinidis [1992] ECR I 6577 and Criminal Proceedings against Lindqvist [2004] QB 1014: see paras 24 and 25, above.\n",
              "Lord Keiths statement in Litster v Forth Dry Dock & Engineering Co Ltd (In Receivership) [1990] 1 AC 546, 554 that it is the duty of the court to give to regulation 5 a construction which accords with the decisions of the European Court upon the corresponding provisions of the Directive to which the regulation was intended by Parliament to give effect must be read subject to this qualification.\n",
              "It is open to the national court, as the Court of Justice said in para 98 of Lindqvist, to extend the scope of the national legislation implementing the provisions of the Directive to areas not included within its scope, provided that no other provisions of Community law preclude it.\n",
              "In the present context this means that it would be open to the national court to give regulations 5(1) and 5(2) their ordinary and natural meaning so long as there was nothing in Werhof that indicates that it is not open to it to do so.\n",
              "Mr Lynch QC for Parkwood submits however that this is exactly what, in the light of the ruling in Werhof, the national court cannot do.\n",
              "Werhof\n",
              "Mr Linden submits that there are two main reasons why Werhof v Freeway Traffic Systems GmbH & Co KG [2006] ECR I 2397 is not to be read as having the effect of overruling the case law of the EAT as indicated by Whent [1997] IRLR 153.\n",
              "The first depends on the facts in Werhof.\n",
              "He submits that it was concerned with a different question from that which arises in this case, as it did not concern a term in the employment contract which incorporated terms and conditions as agreed from time to time by a collective bargaining body such as the NJC.\n",
              "The second is that in any event Werhof merely decided that the Directive did not require the transferred employees to be entitled to the benefit of subsequent collective agreements.\n",
              "It did not prohibit national law from being more generous to the employees, in accordance with our own domestic case law as to the effect of regulation 5 of TUPE.\n",
              "Mr Werhofs terms of employment with his original employer were governed by a framework collective agreement and wages agreement in force at the material time for workers in the North Rhine Westphalia metal and electrical industry negotiated between the trade union for the metal industry, of which he was not a member, and the metal and electrical Industry for North Rhine Westphalia, of which the undertaking was a member: Advocate General, para 17; ECJ, paras 7 and 8.\n",
              "The Advocate General acknowledged that, under German employment law, a contract of employment may refer to other instruments such as collective agreements which have not necessarily been concluded by the contracting parties: para 30.\n",
              "These clauses act statically or dynamically, depending on whether they refer to a specific agreement which is in force or to the agreement applicable at any time to the undertaking or economic sector in which the business is conducted: para 32.\n",
              "Mr Werhofs agreement was of the dynamic kind.\n",
              "This was what gave rise to the problem with which his case was concerned.\n",
              "As the Advocate General explained in para 33, the problem arose as to the legal effects of an agreement of that kind when the undertaking has been transferred, where the transferor was a member of the employers federation with whom the union negotiated but the transferee was not and the collective agreement was replaced by another one after the transfer.\n",
              "The referring court, the Landesarbeitsgericht at Dsseldorf, was in doubt as to whether the right to participate in amendments made to agreements following the transfer was one of the rights that passed to the transferee under article 3(1) of the Directive.\n",
              "This was because, as the Advocate General explained in para 35, in Germany, the Bundesarbeitsgericht (Federal Labour Court) has interpreted paragraph 613a of the BGB stating that, under the second sentence, the collectively agreed rules become a constituent part of the contract of employment with the content that they possess at the time when the business is transferred and subsequent amendments are not relevant, because a right to benefit from the advantages of further dynamic development in negotiation cannot be inferred, since the protection granted to the rights of workers is static; the Bundesarbeitsgericht, combining the first sentence of the provision with paragraphs 3 and 4 of the TVG [Law on Collective Agreements: Advocate General, para 10], also considers that subjection of workers to subsequent collective agreements cannot do without the subjection of the employer; otherwise, if the company were transferred, the position of the employees would depend on the concluding of an arrangement for parity of treatment.\n",
              "The point that the Advocate General was making in the concluding part of this paragraph was that the system of collective bargaining that was in issue in that case was enforceable by statute, which required the employer to be a member of the employers federation that was a party to the collective agreement.\n",
              "The only way the collective agreement could be rendered enforceable, if the statute did not apply to it, would be by entering into a contract which gave parity of treatment to the employee.\n",
              "Mr Werhofs contract of employment was not of that kind.\n",
              "The first sentence of paragraph 613a(1) of the BGB provides that, where a business is transferred to another owner, the rights and obligations arising from the employment relationship existing on the date of the transfer shall pass to the owner.\n",
              "The second sentence provides that, where the rights and obligations are governed by the provisions of a collective or works agreement, they shall be incorporated into the employment relationship with the new owner and the employee.\n",
              "This was the provision that the Federal Labour Court had interpreted as having the effect that such agreements had the content that they possessed at the time when the business was transferred and that subsequent amendments were not relevant.\n",
              "The question that the case raised was whether this interpretation was precluded by article 3(1) of the Directive.\n",
              "The Advocate General drew attention to the distinction between articles 3(1) and 3(2) of the Directive in paras 38 43.\n",
              "Article 3(1) refers to clauses applying to individuals and article 3(2) to those stipulated in a collective agreement.\n",
              "Where the document concluded by the worker and the employer refers to a collective agreement on a matter such as wages it is governed by article 3(1) because it is included in an individual contract.\n",
              "But the collective provision to which the parties refer is governed by article 3(2).\n",
              "He drew attention too to the fact that the right to freedom of association under article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights includes the right not to join or to withdraw from an association: Young, James and Webster v United Kingdom (1981) 4 EHRR 38; Gustafsson v Sweden (1996) 22 EHRR 409, para 45.\n",
              "In para 49 he observed that if the new owner wished to participate in agreements with the unions he would have to join the negotiating employers federation which would curtail his freedom of association.\n",
              "In paras 51 52 the Advocate General said that the right of a person acquiring an undertaking must prevail over any other of lesser importance, such as the right of the employee to the financial advantages arising from the development of the collective agreements signed by the transferor, otherwise the consequences would be similar to contracts imposing obligations on third parties in breach of the general principle pacta tertiis nec nocent.\n",
              "In para 53 he concluded that a dynamic interpretation of the clause in Mr Werhofs contract was inappropriate.\n",
              "He suggested that the Court of Justice should rule that it was not contrary to article 3(1) of the Directive if a transferee, who was not a member of an employers federation which negotiates such agreements, did not apply collective agreements which had replaced the one which was in force at the time of change of ownership.\n",
              "The Court of Justice was more guarded in its approach to the question whether the principle that contracts cannot impose obligations on third parties would be infringed.\n",
              "In paras 24 and 25 it noted that the Community legislature has sought to ensure that, on the transfer of an undertaking, employees enjoyed special protection designed to prevent the erosion which could result from the application of that principle.\n",
              "According to the case law of the court, the Directive was intended to safeguard the rights of employees by allowing them to continue to work for the new employer on the same conditions as those agreed with the transferor.\n",
              "The rights and obligations arising from a collective agreement to which the contract of employment refers were automatically transferred to the new owner even if the new owner was not a party to any collective agreement.\n",
              "That having been said, however, the court found two reasons for holding that Mr Werhof could not maintain that his clause referring to collective agreements must necessarily be dynamic, so that by the application of article 3(1) of the Directive it referred to collective agreements concluded after the date of the transfer.\n",
              "The first was that account had to be taken of article 3(2), which contained limitations to the principle that the collective agreement to which the contract of employment referred was applicable.\n",
              "It showed that the object of the Directive was merely to safeguard the rights and obligations of employees in force on the date of the transfer, and was not intended to protect hypothetical advantages flowing from future changes to collective agreements: paras 28 29.\n",
              "The second was that, although the interests of the employees must be protected, those of the transferee could not be disregarded.\n",
              "If the dynamic interpretation were to be applied it would mean that the transferees fundamental right not to join an association could be affected, whereas that right would be fully safeguarded if the static interpretation were to be adopted: paras 31 35.\n",
              "The Court concluded its judgment with a ruling in these terms, at para 37: .\n",
              "Article 3(1) of the Directive must be interpreted as not precluding, in a situation where the contract of employment refers to a collective agreement binding the transferor, that the transferee, who is not a party to such an agreement, is not bound by collective agreements subsequent to the one which was in force at the time of the transfer of the business. [emphasis added] Is a dynamic interpretation precluded by article 3(1)?\n",
              "The Advocate Generals summary of the facts indicates that the system under national law which applied in Werhof was different from that which formed the context for the appellants contracts of employment with the council.\n",
              "Among other things, the German employment law with reference to which Mr Werhofs employment contract was framed assumes that the employer is a member of the employers federation which is a party to the collective agreement and, in consequence, is bound by statute to comply with it: Advocate General, para 12; see also Employment Law In Europe 2nd ed (2009), paras 11.197 11.200.\n",
              "There is no such statutory obligation in our domestic law, nor is membership of the negotiating body a prerequisite for the enforceability of any agreement that has been reached collectively.\n",
              "It all depends upon what the parties have provided for in their individual contracts.\n",
              "There is therefore something to be said for Mr Lindens submission that the decision in Werhof is distinguishable on its facts, especially as to the point that the Court of Justice made in paras 31 35 of its judgment about the transferees fundamental right not to be required to join an employers federation.\n",
              "The more important point of distinction for present purposes, however, is the second point on which Mr Linden relies: see para 34, above.\n",
              "The question which the Court of Justice addressed by its ruling in Werhof is not the same as that which requires to be answered in this case.\n",
              "It was sufficient to resolve the issue that had been raised by the referring court for it to say that the ruling of the Federal Labour Court summarised by the Advocate General in para 35 of his opinion was not precluded by article 3(1) of the Directive.\n",
              "In our case the question has to be looked at the other way round.\n",
              "This is because, as the Court of Justice recognised in Criminal Proceedings against Lindqvist [2004] QB 1014, para 98, there is nothing to prevent a member state from extending the scope of the national legislation implementing the provisions of the Directive to areas not included within it, so long as no other provisions of Community law preclude this.\n",
              "It would, of course, not be open to the national court to adopt that approach if the effect of the Directive was that it was precluded by it.\n",
              "That is why the way in which the Court of Justice framed its ruling in Werhof does not answer directly the question that needs to be resolved in this case.\n",
              "The absence of a direct answer to it would not have given rise to difficulty if it had been possible to infer from the judgment how the question would have been answered.\n",
              "Mr Lynch invited us to draw that inference, as his case is that the principle enunciated in the judgment is that the transfer of dynamic contractual rights is inconsistent with the Directive so regulation 5 of TUPE must be confined to static contractual rights.\n",
              "But it is not obvious, if it is open to the national courts to interpret legislation that was intended to give effect to the Directive more generously in favour of employees than the Directive itself envisaged, why this should be so.\n",
              "The first of the two reasons for the courts decision, that the object of the Directive was merely to safeguard the rights and obligations of employees in force on the date of the transfer, would not seem to preclude a more generous interpretation if the national court thought that this was appropriate to give effect to the ordinary meaning of TUPE.\n",
              "There are various reasons for thinking that, when TUPE was originally being framed, it was thought that employment contracts such as those which the appellants entered into which provided for a dynamic approach to be taken to collective agreements were permitted by the Directive.\n",
              "The aim of the Directive was to promote approximation of laws among the member states, not their harmonisation.\n",
              "None of the recitals in the preamble refer to a need to balance protection for employers against the protection given to employees in the event of a change of employer.\n",
              "And it was stated in article 7 of the Directive that it was not to affect the right of member states to introduce laws which are more favourable to employees.\n",
              "It hardly needs to be said that the question whether Werhof precludes the dynamic approach, if this is indeed what the employment contract interpreted according to the principles of domestic law provides for, is of fundamental importance to the many employees who work in sectors where their terms and conditions of employment are commonly determined through collective bargaining.\n",
              "The second reason for the courts decision was its finding that, when interpreting the Directive, account had to be taken of the principle of the coherence of the Community legal order which required secondary Community legislation to be interpreted in accordance with the general principles of Community law among which was that the right not to join an association or a union was protected in the Community legal order: paras 32 33.\n",
              "As I have already mentioned, this point was directly relevant in Mr Werhofs case because of the way German employment law deals with collective agreements.\n",
              "Our domestic law is entirely different.\n",
              "There is no equivalent statutory framework.\n",
              "The matter depends entirely on the domestic law of contract, under which parties are at liberty to agree to abide by agreements arrived at by a process in which they do not, and are not required to, participate.\n",

              "The appellants contracts do not require this, and in any event it would not be eligible to do so.\n",
              "In these circumstances, as I consider the answer to the question not to be acte clair, I would refer the issue as to whether article 3(1) of the Directive precludes national courts from giving a dynamic interpretation to regulation 5 of TUPE in the circumstances of this case to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling under article 267 TFEU (ex article 234 EC).\n",

              "In 2004, CCL Ltds undertaking was taken over by the Respondent, another private sector employer.\n",
              "TUPE applied to each of these transfers.\n",
              "The employees therefore first became employees of CCL Ltd and then of the Respondent.\n",

              "The Appellants brought claims for unauthorised deduction from wages.\n",
              "These were dismissed by the Employment Tribunal.\n",
              "The Appellants appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal was successful, but the Court of Appeal restored the Tribunals decision.\n",
              "It held that Werhof meant that Article 3(1) of the Directive did not bind the transferee to any collective agreement made after the transfer and that Regulation 5 TUPE did not indicate any intention to provide employees with greater protection.\n",
              "The Appellants appealed to the Supreme Court.\n",
              "The Supreme Court unanimously holds that there should be a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling to establish whether Article 3(1) of the Directive precludes national courts from giving a dynamic interpretation to Regulation 5 of TUPE in the circumstances of this case.\n",

              "As to the first question, Parliament must be taken to have intended to do no more in enacting Regulations 5(1) and (2) TUPE than implement Article 3(1) of the Directive.\n",

              "Although in some respects TUPE was more generous to employees that the Directive, there was nothing indicating such an intention in Regulations 5(1) & (2).\n",
              "Although it is the 1981 TUPE Regulations which apply to this case, they were replaced by new regulations in 2006, which contained equivalent provisions to Regulations 5(1) & (2).\n",

              "The scope of Article 3 has now been interpreted by the ECJ in Werhof, which was a preliminary reference from Germany.\n",

              "The ECJ held such an approach was not precluded by Article 3(1) of the Directive: [37] [42] The question in this case is a different one: whether a member state is precluded from extending the protection afforded to employees on transfer, so as to provide dynamic protection, where that would be the consequence of an application of domestic contract law: [44].\n",

              "The claims by Susan Smith and by Courtney and Karla Ellis (the Snatch Land Rover claims) fall into two parts.\n",
              "The first, which is common to all three claimants, is that the MOD breached article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights by failing to take measures within the scope of its powers which, judged reasonably, it might have been expected to take in the light of the real and immediate risk to life of soldiers who were required to patrol in Snatch Land Rovers.\n",
              "The second, which is brought by Courtney Ellis only, is based on negligence at common law.\n",
              "The particulars of the Smith claim under article 2 of the Convention are that the MOD (i) failed to provide better/medium armoured vehicles for use by Pte Hewetts commander which, if provided, would have been used for Pte Hewetts patrol, (ii) failed to ensure that any patrol inside Al Amarah was led by a Warrior, (iii) caused or permitted a patrol of three Snatch Land Rovers to proceed inside Al Amarah, especially when there was no ECM on the lead Snatch Land Rover and it knew or ought to have known that ECMs were ineffective against the triggers that were in use by the insurgents and no suitable counter measures had been provided, (iv) permitted the patrol of Snatch Land Rovers to investigate the bomb blast, especially when there was only one road to the decoy bomb site, (v) failed to provide other vehicles for route clearing and route planning ahead of the Snatch Land Rovers, (vi) failed to provide suitable counter measures to IEDs in the light of the death of Lance Corporal Brackenbury, who was killed by an IED while in a Snatch Land Rover on 29 May 2005 and (vii) failed to use means other than patrols to combat the threat posed by the insurgents.\n",
              "The particulars of the Ellis claim under article 2 and in negligence are that the MOD failed (i) to limit his patrol to better, medium or heavily armoured vehicles, (ii) to provide any or any sufficient better or armoured vehicle for use by Pte Elliss commander which, had they been provided, would or should have been used for his patrol and (iii) to ensure that Element A had been fitted to the ECM on Pte Elliss Snatch Land Rover, without which it should not have been permitted to leave the Camp.\n",
              "The MODs primary case in reply to the Challenger claims and the Ellis claim in negligence is that they should all be struck out on the principle of combat immunity.\n",
              "It also pleads that it would not be fair, just or reasonable to impose a duty of care on the MOD in the circumstances of those cases.\n",
              "Its case for a strike out in reply to the Snatch Land Rover claims under article 2 of the Convention falls into two parts.\n",
              "First, it submits that at the time of their deaths Pte Hewett and Pte Ellis were not within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "Secondly, it submits that on the facts as pleaded the MOD did not owe a duty to them at the time of their deaths under article 2.\n",

              "He struck out the Snatch Land Rover claims under article 2 on the ground that Pte Hewett and Pte Ellis were not within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention when they died: para 48.\n",
              "He based this decision on R (Smith) v Oxfordshire Assistant Deputy Coroner (Equality and Human Rights Commission intervening) [2010] UKSC 29, [2011] 1 AC 1.\n",
              "He went on nevertheless, in a carefully reasoned judgment, to address the question whether, if the deceased were within the Convention jurisdiction, the MOD was under a substantive article 2 duty of the kind that the Snatch Land Rover claimants were contending for.\n",
              "He said that he would not have struck out their claims relating to the supply of equipment: para 80.\n",
              "But in his judgment there was no sound basis for extending the scope of the implied positive duty under article 2 to decisions made in the course of military operations by commanders: para 81.\n",
              "Holding that the doctrine of combat immunity should be narrowly construed, he refused to strike out the Challenger claims and the second and third of the three Ellis claims in negligence because he was not persuaded that their equipment and pre deployment training claims were bound to fail: paras 110, 111.\n",
              "But he struck out the first of the Ellis claims because he was of the opinion that this claim fell squarely within the scope of combat immunity: para 114.\n",
              "On 19 October 2012 the Court of Appeal (Lord Neuberger MR, Moses and Rimer LJJ) dismissed appeals by the Snatch Land Rover claimants on the question whether the deceased were within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention: [2012] EWCA Civ 1365, [2013] 2 WLR 27.\n",
              "It found it unnecessary to deal with the extent of the substantive obligations implicit within that article.\n",

              "But it allowed a cross appeal by the Ellis claimants against the striking out of the first Ellis claim.\n",
              "This was because, although the allegation was of failures of the MOD away from the theatre of war, there might be factual questions as to the circumstances in which the decisions were made which would enable the MOD to raise the defence of combat immunity at the trial: para 63.\n",
              "All these issues are now the subject of appeals by the claimants and a cross appeal by the MOD to this court.\n",
              "It will be convenient to take first the question whether at the time of their deaths Pte Hewett and Pte Ellis were within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "If they were, I propose to consider next the question whether article 2 imposes positive obligations on the states party to the Convention with a view to preventing the deaths of their own soldiers in active operations against the enemy.\n",
              "Finally, there are the claims made at common law where the question is whether the allegations of negligence by the Challenger and Ellis claimants should be struck out because they fall within the scope of combat immunity or because it would not be fair, just or reasonable to impose a duty to take care to protect against such death or injury.\n",

              "In Soering v United Kingdom (1989) 11 EHRR 439 at para 86 the Strasbourg court said that article 1 sets a limit, notably territorial, on the reach of the Convention and that the engagement undertaken by a contracting state is confined to securing the listed rights and freedoms to persons within its own jurisdiction.\n",
              "It does not govern the actions of states not parties to it, nor does it purport to be a means of requiring the contracting state to impose Convention standards on other states.\n",
              "The essentially territorial notion of jurisdiction was also emphasised by the Grand Chamber in Bankovic v Belgium (2001) 11 BHRC 435, para 67, where it said that it is only in exceptional cases that acts of the contracting states performed, or producing effects, outside their territories can constitute an exercise of jurisdiction by them within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "In Andrejeva v Latvia, (Application No 55707/00), given 18 February 2009, para 56, the Grand Chamber reiterated that the concept of jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1 reflects that terms meaning in public international law and that it is closely linked to the international responsibility of the state concerned.\n",
              "The question that the Snatch Land Rover claims raise is whether the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom extends to securing the protection of article 2 of the Convention to members of the armed forces when they are serving outside its territory.\n",
              "For that to be so it would have to be recognised that service abroad by members of the armed forces is an exceptional circumstance which requires and justifies the exercise by the State of its jurisdiction over them extra territorially.\n",

              "One of them, Mr Baha Mousa, had died as a result of severe maltreatment in a prison occupied and run by British military personnel.\n",
              "It was argued for the civilians that, because of the special circumstances in which British troops were operating in Basra, the conduct complained of, although taking place outside the borders of the United Kingdom and any other contracting state, fell within the exceptions recognised by the Strasbourg jurisprudence.\n",
              "The House held that, although one such exception was recognised where a state through effective control of another territory exercised powers normally exercised by the government of that territory, the obligation to secure the Convention rights would arise only where a contracting state had such effective control over an area as to enable it to provide the full package of rights and freedoms guaranteed by article 1 of the Convention to everyone within that area: Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 79; Lord Brown of Eaton under Heywood at para 129.\n",
              "The United Kingdoms presence in Iraq fell far short of such control.\n",
              "As Lord Rodger put it in para 78, the idea that the United Kingdom was obliged to secure the observance of all the rights and freedoms as interpreted by the European court in the utterly different society of southern Iraq was manifestly absurd.\n",
              "The Secretary of State accepted that, as the events occurred in a British detention unit, Mr Mousa met his death within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention: Lord Rodger at para 61.\n",
              "So far as the other appellants were concerned, the United Kingdom did not have the kind of control of Basra and the surrounding area that would have allowed it to have discharged its obligations, including its positive obligations, as a contracting state under article 2.\n",
              "Three aspects of the discussion of the issue in that case should be noted at this stage.\n",
              "First, the appellants were all citizens of Iraq.\n",
              "They were not state agents of the United Kingdom or otherwise subject to its control or authority.\n",
              "British servicemen, on the other hand, are under the complete control of the UK authorities and are subject exclusively to UK law.\n",
              "Secondly, the House was plainly much influenced by the ruling on jurisdiction by the Grand Chamber in Bankovic which emphasised the centrality of territorial jurisdiction, the regional nature of the Convention and the indivisibility of the package of rights in the Convention: Lord Rodger at para 69.\n",
              "As Lord Brown noted in para 109, Bankovic stood, among other things, for the proposition that the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention could not be divided and tailored.\n",
              "In para 75 of Bankovic the proposition which attracted these observations was in these terms: . the Court is of the view that the wording of article 1 does not provide any support for the applicants suggestion that the positive obligation in article 1 to secure the rights and freedoms defined in section 1 of this Convention can be divided and tailored in accordance with the particular circumstances of the extra territorial act in question.\n",
              "In para 65 of its judgment in that case the Grand Chamber said that the scope of article 1 was determinative of the very scope of the contracting parties positive obligations and, as such, of the scope and reach of the entire Convention system of human rights protection.\n",
              "Thirdly, it was recognised that it was for the Strasbourg court to define the exceptions and evaluate the grounds for departing from the general rule: Lord Bingham of Cornhill at para 29.\n",
              "As Lord Brown put it at para 105, the ultimate decision on the question must necessarily be for that court.\n",
              "Lord Rodger referred at para 67 to the problem which the House had to face, which was that the judgments and decisions of the European court did not speak with one voice.\n",
              "On the one hand there was Issa v Turkey (2004) 41 EHRR 567, where the court said at para 71 that accountability for violation of the Convention rights and freedoms of persons in another state stems from the fact that article 1 of the Convention cannot be interpreted so as to allow a state party to perpetrate violations of the Convention on the territory of the other state which it could not perpetrate on its own territory.\n",
              "This appeared to focus on the activity of the contracting state, whereas the emphasis in Bankovic was on the requirement that the victim should be within the jurisdiction.\n",
              "In these circumstances the House was of the view that it would not be proper to proceed beyond the jurisprudence of the European court on jurisdiction as analysed and declared by the Grand Chamber in Bankovic.\n",
              "The appellants then sought just satisfaction in Strasbourg.\n",
              "In the meantime the jurisdiction question was considered by the domestic court in two further cases: R (Gentle) v Prime Minister [2008] AC 1356 and R (Smith) v Oxfordshire Assistant Deputy Coroner (Equality and Human Rights Commission intervening) [2010] UKSC 29, [2011] 1 AC 1 (Catherine Smith).\n",
              "The question in Gentle was whether article 2 of the Convention imposed a substantive duty on the state to take timely steps to obtain reliable legal advice before committing its troops to armed conflict: see para 3.\n",
              "The claimants were the mothers of two soldiers who were killed while serving in Iraq, one of whom was killed by the same shell as killed Cpl Allbutt and injured Trooper Julien and Lance Corporal Twiddy: see para 3, above.\n",
              "The issue which the claimants wished to explore was the lawfulness of the military action on which the United Kingdom had been engaged in Iraq before it was legitimised by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 of 8 June 2004.\n",
              "Lord Bingham said at para 8(3) that, although the soldiers were subject to the authority of the United Kingdom, they were clearly not within its jurisdiction as that expression in the Convention had been interpreted in Al Skeini (HL), paras 79 and 129.\n",
              "But the case was decided on the basis that the claimants were unable to establish the duty which they asserted: see Lord Bingham at para 6.\n",
              "In para 39 Lord Rodger said article 2 of the Convention did not impose an obligation on the government not to take part in an invasion that was unlawful in international law: see also Baroness Hale of Richmond, para 57.\n",
              "In para 19 I said that the guarantee in the first sentence of that article was not violated simply by deploying servicemen and women on active service overseas as part of an organised military force which was properly equipped and capable of defending itself, even though the risk of their being killed was inherent in what they were being asked to do.\n",
              "The issue in Catherine Smith was whether a British soldier in Iraq when outside his base was within the scope of the Convention.\n",
              "The appellant was the mother of Private Jason Smith who had been mobilised for service in Iraq as a member of the Territorial Army and was stationed at Camp Abu Naji.\n",
              "He collapsed while working off base.\n",
              "He was rushed by ambulance to the Camps medical centre but died there almost immediately of heat stroke.\n",
              "The issue in the case concentrated on the question whether the inquest into his death had to satisfy the procedural requirements of article 2.\n",
              "The Secretary of State conceded that, as Private Smith was on the base when he died, Mrs Smith was entitled to the relief which she sought.\n",
              "This meant that the issue had become largely academic, as Lord Phillips recognised in para 2.\n",
              "But on this occasion the Court decided to examine the question and express its opinion on it.\n",
              "The Court was divided on the issue by six to three.\n",
              "The majority held that the contracting states, in concluding the provisions of the Convention, would not have intended it to apply to their armed forces when operating outside their territories.\n",
              "Lord Collins, who delivered the leading judgment on behalf of the majority, said in para 307 that the case came within none of the exceptions recognised by the Strasbourg court, and that there was no basis in its case law, or in principle, for the proposition that the jurisdiction which states undoubtedly have over their armed forces abroad both in national law and international law means that they are within their jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1.\n",
              "Repeating a point that had been made by Lord Rodger in Al Skeini (HL), he said that, to the extent that Issa v Turkey stated a principle of jurisdiction based solely on authority and control by state agents, it was inconsistent with Bankovic.\n",
              "In para 308 he said that there were no policy grounds for extending the scope of the Convention to armed forces abroad, as this would ultimately involve the courts in issues relating to the conduct of armed hostilities which was essentially non justiciable.\n",
              "The leading judgment for the minority was delivered by Lord Mance, with whom Lady Hale and Lord Kerr agreed.\n",
              "It is not possible to do justice to it in a brief summary.\n",
              "But some points that are of particular importance should be noted.\n",
              "In para 188 he said that, to the extent that jurisdiction under the Convention exists over occupied territory, it does so only because of the occupying states pre existing authority and control over its own armed forces.\n",
              "An occupying state cannot have any jurisdiction over local inhabitants without already having jurisdiction over its own armed forces, in both cases in the sense of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "In para 194 he said that the United Kingdoms jurisdiction over its armed forces was essentially personal.\n",
              "It could not be expected to take steps to provide in Iraq the full social and protective framework and facilities which it would be expected to provide domestically.\n",
              "But the United Kingdom could be expected to take steps to provide proper facilities and proper protection against risks falling within its responsibility or its ability to control or influence when despatching and deploying armed forces overseas.\n",
              "In paras 195 197 he examined the question whether there would be consequences beyond or outside any that the framers of the Convention could have contemplated and concluded that none of the matters that might give cause for concern justified giving to the concept of jurisdiction a different or more limited meaning to that which in his opinion followed from the guidance that the Strasbourg court had already given in Bankovic.\n",
              "It is however worth noting that he did not attach the same importance as the majority did to the proposition in Bankovic that the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention could not be divided and tailored, and that he was inclined to give more weight than they were to a principle of jurisdiction based on the authority and control which the contracting state had over its armed forces.\n",
              "(b) Al Skeini in Strasbourg\n",
              "The structure of the relevant part of the Grand Chambers judgment, at (2011) 53 EHRR 589, falls into two parts.\n",
              "First, there is a comprehensive statement of general principles relevant to the issue of jurisdiction under article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "Secondly, those principles are applied to the facts of the case.\n",
              "Although the facts of that case are different from those which are before this Court in these appeals, both parts of the judgment provide important guidance as to how we should resolve the issue with which we have to deal.\n",
              "The statement of general principles begins in para 130 with the observation that the exercise of jurisdiction, which is a threshold condition, is a necessary condition for a contracting state to be able to be held responsible for acts or omissions imputable to it which give rise to an allegation of the infringement of rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention.\n",
              "The significance of this observation in the context of these appeals is that it is not disputed that the United Kingdom has authority and control over its armed forces when serving abroad.\n",
              "It has just as much authority and control over them anywhere as it has when they are serving within the territory of the United Kingdom.\n",
              "They are subject to UK military law without any territorial limit: Armed Forces Act 2006, section 367(1).\n",
              "The extent of the day to day control will, of course, vary from time to time when the forces are deployed in active service overseas, especially when troops are in face to face combat with the enemy.\n",
              "But the legal and administrative structure of the control is, necessarily, non territorial in character.\n",
              "are set out: In paras 131 132 the general principles relevant to the territorial principle 131 A states jurisdictional competence under article 1 is primarily territorial.\n",
              "Jurisdiction is presumed to be exercised normally throughout the states territory.\n",
              "Conversely, acts of the contracting states performed, or producing effects, outside their territories can constitute an exercise of jurisdiction within the meaning of article 1 only in exceptional cases. 132 To date, the Court in its case law has recognised a number of exceptional circumstances capable of giving rise to the exercise of jurisdiction by a contracting state outside its own territorial boundaries.\n",
              "In each case, the question whether exceptional circumstances exist which require and justify a finding by the Court that the state was exercising jurisdiction extra territorially must be determined with reference to the particular facts.\n",
              "One can take from these paragraphs two important points.\n",
              "First, the word exceptional is there not to set an especially high threshold for circumstances to cross before they can justify a finding that the state was exercising jurisdiction extra territorially.\n",
              "It is there to make it clear that, for this purpose, the normal presumption that applies throughout the states territory does not apply.\n",
              "Secondly, the words to date in para 132 indicate that the list of circumstances which may require and justify a finding that the state was exercising jurisdiction extra territorially is not closed.\n",
              "In Catherine Smith, para 303 Lord Collins said that Bankovic made it clear in paras 64 and 65 that article 1 was not to be interpreted as a living instrument in accordance with changing conditions.\n",
              "That can no longer be regarded as an entirely accurate statement.\n",
              "The general principles are derived from the application to particular facts of the requirement of jurisdictional competence.\n",
              "The particular facts to which those principles must now be applied may be the product of circumstances that were not foreseen by the framers of the Convention.\n",
              "But that is no reason to disregard them if they can be shown to fall within the general principles relevant to jurisdiction under article 1.\n",
              "The Grand Chamber in Al Skeini then set out to divide the general principles relevant to jurisdiction into three distinct categories: state agent authority and control; effective control over an area; and the Convention legal space.\n",
              "We are not concerned in the case of the Snatch Land Rover claims with a situation where, as a consequence of military action, the United Kingdom was in effective control of an area outside its territory.\n",
              "Its presence in Iraq in 2005 and 2006 was to provide security and help with the reconstruction effort in that country pursuant to a request by the Iraqi government.\n",
              "The local administration was in the hands of the Iraqi government.\n",
              "Nor are we concerned with the risk of a vacuum in the Convention legal space.\n",
              "The category relevant to this case is that of state agent authority and control, which is described in paras 133 to 137.\n",
              "This category is introduced by para 133, which is in these terms: The Court has recognised in its case law that, as an exception to the principle of territoriality, a contracting states jurisdiction under article 1 may extend to acts of its authorities which produce effects outside its own territory: see Drozd and Janousek v France and Spain (1992) EHRR 745, para 91; Loizidou v Turkey (1995) 20 EHRR 99 (preliminary objections), para 62; Loizidou v Turkey (1997) 23 EHRR 513 (merits), para 52; Bankovic v Belgium (2004) 44 EHRR SE75, para 69.\n",
              "The statement of principle, as it appears in Drozd and the other cases just cited, is very broad: the Court states merely that the contracting partys responsibility can be involved in these circumstances.\n",
              "It is necessary to examine the Courts case law to identify the defining principles.\n",
              "There then follow three paragraphs in which the principles are defined by reference to the Courts case law.\n",
              "The first principle is set out in para 134.\n",
              "It refers to the acts of diplomatic and consular agents, who are present on foreign territory in accordance with provisions of international law.\n",
              "This may amount to an exercise of jurisdiction when these agents exert authority and control over others.\n",
              "The cases cited are X v Federal Republic of Germany (1965) 8 Yearbook of the European Convention on Human Rights 158; X v United Kingdom (1977) 12 DR 73; M v Denmark (1992) 73 DR 193; and Bankovic, para 73, where the Court noted that other recognised instances of the extra territorial exercise of jurisdiction by a state include cases involving the activities of its diplomatic or consular agents abroad and on board craft and vessels registered in, or flying the flag of, that state.\n",
              "In these specific situations, customary international law and treaty provisions have recognised the extra territorial exercise of jurisdiction by the relevant state.\n",
              "The second principle is set out in para 135.\n",
              "It refers to the fact that the Court has recognised the exercise of extra territorial jurisdiction by a contracting state when, through the consent, invitation or acquiescence of the government of that territory, it exercises all or some of the public powers normally to be exercised by that government: Bankovic, para 71.\n",
              "So, where in accordance with custom, treaty or other agreement, authorities of the contracting state carry out executive or judicial functions on the territory of another state, the contracting state may be responsible for breaches of the Convention that result from their exercise, so long as the acts in question are attributable to it rather than to the state in whose territory the acts take place.\n",
              "The cases cited are Drozd and Janousek v France and Spain (1992) 14 EHRR 745; Gentilhomme v France (Application Nos 48205, 48207 and 48209), given 14 May 2002; and X and Y v Switzerland (1977) 9 DR 57.\n",
              "The third principle is set out in para 136.\n",
              "It refers to the fact that the Courts case law demonstrates that in certain circumstances the use of force by a states agents operating outside its territory may bring the individual thereby brought under control of the states authorities into the states article 1 jurisdiction.\n",
              "Four examples are given of the application of this principle to cases where an individual was taken into the custody of state agents abroad: calan v Turkey (2005) 41 EHRR 985, where an individual was handed over to Turkish officials outside the territory of Turkey by officials from Kenya; Issa v Turkey (2004) 41 EHRR 567, where the Court indicated in paras 74 77 that if it had been established that Turkish soldiers had taken the shepherds into custody in a nearby cave in Northern Iraq and executed them, the deceased would have been within Turkish jurisdiction by virtue of the soldiers authority and control over them; Al Saadoon v United Kingdom (2009) 49 EHRR SE95 where the Court held that two Iraqi nationals detained in a British controlled prison in Iraq fell within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom as the United Kingdom exercised total control over the prison and the individuals detained in them; and Medvedyev v France (2010) 51 EHRR 899, where crew members of a Cambodian registered merchant ship suspected of drug smuggling were taken into custody and detained on a French frigate while it was taken to France.\n",
              "A more recent example of the application of the same principle is to be found in Jamaa v Italy (2012) 55 EHRR 627, where the applicant asylum seekers were detained on an Italian ship after their vessels had been intercepted by the Italian Revenue Police and Coastguard.\n",
              "The following words are set out at the end of para 136 which sum up the essence of the general principle: The Court does not consider that jurisdiction in the above cases arose solely from the control exercised by the contracting state over the buildings, aircraft or ship in which the individuals were held.\n",
              "What is decisive in such cases is the exercise of physical power and control over the person in question.\n",
              "The description of the category of state agent authority and control concludes with an important statement in para 137.\n",
              "It is in these terms: It is clear that, whenever the state through its agents exercises control and authority over an individual, and thus jurisdiction, the state is under an obligation under article 1 to secure to that individual the rights and freedoms under section 1 of the Convention that are relevant to the situation of that individual.\n",
              "In this sense, therefore, the Convention rights can be divided and tailored .\n",
              "I do not read the first sentence of this paragraph as adding a further example to those already listed in paras 134 136.\n",
              "No further cases are cited in support of it, which the Court would have been careful to do if that were the case.\n",
              "The point that the Grand Chamber was making in para 137, as is made clear by the last sentence, is that the package of rights in the Convention is not indivisible, as Bankovic, para 75, which is cited here, appeared to indicate.\n",
              "The Grand Chamber had stated in that paragraph of its judgment in Bankovic that it was of the view that the wording of article 1 did not provide any support for the applicants suggestion that the positive obligation in article 1 to secure the rights and freedoms defined in section 1 of this Convention can be divided and tailored in accordance with the particular circumstances of the extra territorial act in question.\n",
              "The effect of para 137 of the Al Skeini judgment is that this proposition, which informed much of the thinking of the House of Lords in Al Skeini (HL) and of the majority in Catherine Smith, that the rights in Section 1 of the Convention are indivisible, is no longer to be regarded as good law.\n",
              "The extra territorial obligation of the contracting state is to ensure the observance of the rights and freedoms that are relevant to the individual who is under its agents authority and control, and it does not need to be more than that.\n",
              "The dividing and tailoring concept relative to the situation of the individual was applied in the Hirsi Jamaa case to resolve the issue whether the asylum seekers were subject to the jurisdiction of Italy while they were detained on the ship flying the Italian flag: 55 EHRR 627, para 74.\n",
              "The second part of the judgment of the Grand Chamber applies the principles described in the first part to the facts of the case.\n",
              "The state of affairs in Iraq during the period when the applicants deaths at the hands of British forces occurred is reviewed in paras 143 to 148.\n",
              "They were killed on various dates between May and September 2003.\n",
              "This was during a period when the United States and the United Kingdom were exercising the powers of government for the provisional administration of Iraq through a Coalition Provisional Authority, which had been created for the purpose in May 2003.\n",
              "They included the maintenance of civil law and order.\n",
              "That remained the position until 28 June 2004, when full authority for governing Iraq passed from the Coalition Provisional Authority to the Interim Iraqi Government.\n",
              "In the light of these facts the Court held in para 149 that the United Kingdom, through its soldiers engaged in security operations in Basra during the period in question, exercised authority and control over individuals killed in the course of such security operations.\n",
              "This established a jurisdictional link between the deceased and the United Kingdom for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "The Court does not say which of the general principles led it to this conclusion, but it is reasonably clear that the facts come closest to those referred to in para 135.\n",
              "The United Kingdom was not exercising public powers through the consent, invitation or acquiescence of the government of Iraq as during the relevant period no such government was in existence.\n",
              "But it was exercising powers normally to be exercised by that government had it existed.\n",
              "The case thus fell within the general principle of state authority and control.\n",
              "It should be noted, however, that the situation in Iraq had changed by the time the incidents that have given rise to the Snatch Land Rover claims occurred.\n",
              "These incidents took place on 16 July 2005 and 28 February 2006.\n",
              "By that stage the occupation of Iraq had come to an end and the Coalition Provisional Authority had ceased to exist.\n",
              "Full authority for governing the country had passed to the Interim Iraqi Government.\n",
              "The United Kingdom was no longer exercising the public powers normally to be exercised by that countrys government.\n",
              "(c) discussion\n",
              "The question whether at the time of their deaths Pte Hewett and Pte Ellis were within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention does not receive a direct answer from the Grand Chamber in its Al Skeini judgment.\n",
              "This is not surprising, as that was not the question it had to decide.\n",
              "As it made clear in para 132, the question whether the state was exercising jurisdiction extra territorially in any given case must be determined with reference to the particular facts of that case.\n",
              "But the insertion of the words to date at the beginning of that paragraph indicate that one should not be too troubled by the fact that no case has yet come before the Strasbourg court which required it to consider whether the jurisdiction which states undoubtedly have over their armed forces abroad in both national and international law means that they are within their jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "Care must, of course, be exercised by a national court in its interpretation of an instrument, the correct interpretation of which can be authoritatively expounded only by the Strasbourg court: R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator [2004] UKHL 26, [2004] 2 AC 323, para 20 per Lord Bingham.\n",
              "He had already acknowledged in Brown v Stott [2003] 1 AC 681 that, as an important constitutional instrument, the Convention was to be seen as a living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits (Edwards v Attorney General for Canada [1930] AC 124 at p 136 per Lord Sankey LC).\n",
              "But he said that those limits will often call for very careful consideration.\n",
              "As he put it at the end of para 20 in Ullah, the duty of national courts is to keep pace with the Strasbourg jurisprudence as it evolves over time.\n",
              "Lord Binghams point was that Parliament never intended by enacting the Human Rights Act 1998 to give the courts of this country the power to give a more generous scope to the Convention rights than that which was to be found in the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court.\n",
              "To do so would have the effect of changing them from Convention rights, based on the treaty obligation, into free standing rights of the courts own creation.\n",
              "In Al Skeini (HL), paras 105 106, Lord Brown of Eaton under Heywood saw a greater danger in the national court construing the Convention too generously in favour of an applicant than in construing it too narrowly.\n",
              "The question before us here, however, is not one as to the scope that should be given to the Convention rights, as to which our jurisprudence is still evolving.\n",
              "It is a question about the states jurisdictional competence under article 1.\n",
              "In this context, as the question of jurisdiction is so fundamental to the extent of the obligations that must be assumed to have been undertaken by the contracting states, the need for care is all the greater.\n",
              "In Catherine Smith, para 93, I endorsed the view expressed by Lord Brown in Al Skeini (HL), para 107 that article 1 should not be construed as reaching any further than the existing Strasbourg jurisprudence clearly shows it to reach.\n",
              "I would take that as being for us, as a national court, the guiding principle.\n",
              "It seems to me that three elements can be extracted from the Grand Chambers Al Skeini judgment which point clearly to the conclusion that the view that was taken by the majority in Catherine Smith that the states armed forces abroad are not within its jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1 can no longer be maintained.\n",
              "The first is to be found in its formulation of the general principle of jurisdiction with respect to state agent authority and control.\n",
              "The whole structure of the judgment is designed to identify general principles with reference to which the national courts may exercise their own judgment as to whether or not, in a case whose facts are not identical to those which have already been held by Strasbourg to justify such a finding, the state was exercising jurisdiction within the meaning of article 1 extra territorially.\n",
              "While the first sentence of para 137 does not add a further example of the application of the principle to those already listed in paras 134 136, it does indicate the extent to which the principle relating to state agent authority and control is to be regarded as one of general application.\n",
              "The words whenever the state through its agents exercises control and authority over an individual, and thus jurisdiction, can be taken to be a summary of the exceptional circumstances in which, under this category, the state can be held to be exercising its jurisdiction extra territorially.\n",
              "As I said in para 30, above, the word exceptional does not set an especially high threshold for circumstances to cross before they can justify such a finding.\n",
              "It is there simply to make it clear that, for this purpose, the normal presumption that applies throughout the states territory does not apply.\n",
              "Lord Collinss comment in Catherine Smith, para 305, that other bases of jurisdiction are exceptional and require special justification should be understood in that sense.\n",
              "The second is to be found in the way, albeit with a degree of reticence, that this formulation resolves the inconsistency between Issa v Turkey and Bankovic on the question whether the test to be applied in these exceptional cases can be satisfied by looking only at authority and control or is still essentially territorial.\n",
              "The problem that was created by this inconsistency was articulated most clearly by Lord Rodger in Al Skeini (HL), paras 71 75.\n",
              "How can one reconcile the decision in Bankovic, which showed that an act which would engage the Convention if committed on the territory of a contracting state does not ipso facto engage the Convention if carried out by that contracting state on the territory of another state outside the Council of Europe, with the test that was described in Issa that required the court to ascertain whether the deceased were under the authority and control of the respondent state? We now know that Issa cannot be dismissed as an aberration because, as Lord Collins said in Catherine Smith, para 307, it is inconsistent with Bankovic.\n",
              "It is Bankovic which can no longer be regarded as authoritative on this point.\n",
              "The fact that Issa is included in para 136 as one of the examples of cases that fall within the general principle of state agent authority and control is particularly noteworthy.\n",
              "It anchors that case firmly in the mainstream of the Strasbourg courts jurisprudence on this topic.\n",
              "The third is to be found in the way that the Grand Chamber has departed from the indication in Bankovic that the package of rights in the Convention is indivisible and cannot be divided and tailored to the particular circumstances of the extra territorial act in question.\n",
              "It was always going to be difficult to see how, if that was to be the guiding principle, it could be possible to accept that a states armed forces abroad in whatever circumstances were within their jurisdiction for the purposes of article 1 as its ability to guarantee the entire range of the Convention rights would in many cases be severely limited.\n",
              "The problem was solved in the case of the actions of Turkish soldiers in northern Cyprus because the Convention rights were also engaged by the acts of the local administration which survived by virtue of Turkish military and other support: Cyprus v Turkey (Application No 25781/94), given 10 May 2001, para 77.\n",
              "Other cases were likely to be more difficult, and Lord Collins recognised in Catherine Smith, para 302 that cases such as Markovic v Italy (2006) 44 EHRR 1045 suggested that some qualification would have to be made to the principle of indivisibility of Convention rights.\n",
              "The Grand Chamber has now taken matters a step further.\n",
              "The concept of dividing and tailoring goes hand in hand with the principle that extra territorial jurisdiction can exist whenever a state through its agents exercises authority and control over an individual.\n",
              "The court need not now concern itself with the question whether the state is in a position to guarantee Convention rights to that individual other than those it is said to have breached: see Jamaa v Italy 55 EHRR 627.\n",
              "There is one other point arising from the Grand Chambers Al Skeini judgment that should not pass unnoticed.\n",
              "The Equality and Human Rights Commission points out in para 49 of its written case that the anterior question that presents itself in state agent cases is whether the state agent himself is within his states jurisdiction within the meaning of article 1.\n",
              "As Lord Mance observed in Catherine Smith, para 188, to the extent that a states extra territorial jurisdiction over local inhabitants exists because of the authority and control that is exercised over them, this is because of the authority and control that the state has over its own armed forces.\n",
              "It would seem to follow therefore that an occupying state cannot have any jurisdiction over local inhabitants without already having jurisdiction over its own armed forces, in each case in the sense of article 1 of the Convention.\n",
              "That this is so has never been questioned by the Strasbourg court, and it may be said that it is the premise from which extra territorial jurisdiction based on state agent authority and control has been developed.\n",
              "In Cyprus v Turkey (1975) 2 DR 125, which appears to have been the first case in which the concept of state agent authority and control was mentioned (see Al Skeini, para 121), the European Commission of Human Rights observed at p 136, para 8, that authorised agents of a state, including diplomatic or consular agents and armed forces, not only remain under its jurisdiction when abroad but bring other persons or property within the jurisdiction of that state, to the extent that they exercise authority over such person or property.\n",
              "In so far as, by their acts or omissions, they affect such persons or property, the responsibility of the state is engaged.\n",
              "The same formulation is to be found in the Commissions decisions in W v Ireland (1983) 32 DR 211, 215 and Vearncombe v Germany and United Kingdom (1989) 59 DR 186, 194.\n",
              "It no longer appears in references by the Strasbourg court to the acts of diplomatic and consular agents present on foreign territory in accordance with provisions of international law: see X and Y v Switzerland 9 DR 57, para 2; Bankovic, para 73; Al Skeini, para 134.\n",
              "But it has never been disapproved.\n",
              "It was quoted without comment or criticism in Chrysostomos v Turkey (1991) 34 Yearbook of the European Convention on Human Rights 35, para 32.\n",
              "The Grand Chamber in Al Skeini was referred by the applicants to the same passage in the Cyprus judgment: see para 121.\n",
              "The quotation from it in that paragraph includes the proposition that authorised agents of a state remain under its jurisdiction when abroad.\n",
              "The Grand Chamber had the opportunity to say that there was something wrong with it, but it did not do so.\n",
              "The Cyprus case was referred to by Lord Phillips in Catherine Smith, paras 49 50.\n",
              "He did not attach any significance to it, as it seemed to him that the reasoning of the Commission was far wider than that of the Court when it dealt with Turkeys jurisdiction in Northern Cyprus in Loizidou v Turkey (1995) 20 EHRR 99.\n",
              "It receives a passing mention also by Lord Collins in para 249 in the course of a brief review of the cases on acts of diplomatic and consular officials abroad.\n",
              "As matters now stand, given the guidance that has now been given in Al Skeini, it deserves more attention.\n",
              "The logic which lies behind it, as explained by Lord Mance in Catherine Smith, para 188, is compelling.\n",
              "It is plain, especially when one thinks of the way the armed forces operate, that authority and control is exercised by the state throughout the chain of command from the very top all the way down to men and women operating in the front line.\n",
              "Servicemen and women relinquish almost total control over their lives to the state.\n",
              "It does not seem possible to separate them, in their capacity as state agents, from those whom they affect when they are exercising authority and control on the states behalf.\n",
              "They are all brought within the states article 1 jurisdiction by the application of the same general principle.\n",
              "In Demir and Baykara v Turkey (Application No 34503/97), given 12 November 2008, para 74, the Grand Chamber said that in a number of judgments it had used, for the purposes of interpreting the Convention, intrinsically non binding instruments of Council of Europe organs, in particular recommendations and resolutions of the Committee of Ministers and the Parliamentary Assembly.\n",
              "These resolutions and recommendations constitute agreements within the meaning of article 31(3)(a) of the Vienna Convention, account of which may be taken in the interpretation of a treaty or the application of its provisions.\n",
              "It is therefore worth noting recommendation 1742 (2006) of the Parliamentary Assembly on the human rights of members of the armed forces of 11 April 2006, which was made in the light of a debate on a report on this issue of its Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights (doc 10861).\n",
              "In para 2 of recommendation 1742 the point was made that members of the armed forces are citizens in uniform who must enjoy the same fundamental freedoms and the same protection of their rights and dignity as any other citizen, within the limits imposed by the specific exigencies of military duties.\n",
              "In para 3 it was emphasised that members of the armed forces cannot be expected to respect humanitarian law and human rights in their operations unless respect for human rights is guaranteed within the army ranks.\n",
              "The Parliamentary Assembly recommended that the Committee of Ministers should prepare and adopt guidelines in the form of a new recommendation to member states designed to guarantee respect for human rights by and within the armed forces.\n",
              "A draft recommendation prepared by a steering committee was adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 24 February 2010 with an explanatory memorandum (CM/Rec (2010) 4) in which it was stated that member states should, so far as possible, apply the principles set out in the recommendation to their armed forces in all circumstances, including in time of armed conflict.\n",
              "The conclusion which I would draw from the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court derives further support from these non binding recommendations.\n",
              "For these reasons I would hold that the decision in Catherine Smith should be departed from as it is inconsistent with the guidance that the Grand Chamber has now given in its Al Skeini judgment.\n",
              "I would also hold that the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom under article 1 of the Convention extends to securing the protection of article 2 to members of the armed forces when they are serving outside its territory and that at the time of their deaths Pte Hewett and Pte Ellis were within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for the purposes of that article.\n",
              "To do so would not be inconsistent with the general principles of international law, as no other state is claiming jurisdiction over them.\n",
              "The extent of that protection, and in particular whether the MOD was under a substantive duty of the kind for which the Snatch Land Rover claimants contend, is the question which must now be considered.\n",
              "The article 2 ECHR claims\n",
              "Article 2(1) of the Convention provides as follows: Everyones right to life shall be protected by law.\n",
              "No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.\n",
              "The relevant guarantee for the purposes of this case is set out in the first sentence.\n",
              "It has two aspects: one substantive, the other procedural.\n",
              "We are not concerned here with the procedural obligation which is implied into the article in order to make sure that the substantive right is effective in practice: see R (Gentle) v Prime Minister [2008] AC 1356, para 5, per Lord Bingham.\n",
              "The Snatch Land Rover claims, details of which are set out in paras 11 and 12, above, are all directed to the substantive obligation, which requires the state not to take life without justification and also, by implication, to establish a framework of laws, precautions, procedures and means of enforcement which will, to the greatest extent reasonably practicable, protect life: R (Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner [2004] UKHL 10, [2004] 2 AC 182, para 2.\n",
              "As Owen J pointed out, these claims involve issues of procurement as well as allegations relating to operational decisions made by commanders: [2011] EWHC 1676 (QB), para 51.\n",
              "(a) preliminary observations\n",
              "Lord Collins said in Catherine Smith, para 308 that to extend the scope of the Convention to armed forces abroad would ultimately involve the courts in issues relating to the conduct of armed hostilities which are essentially non justiciable.\n",
              "That some issues relating to the conduct of armed hostilities are non justiciable is not really in doubt.\n",
              "But in my opinion a finding that in all circumstances deaths or injuries in combat that result from the conduct of operations by the armed forces are outside the scope of article 2 would not be sustainable.\n",
              "It would amount, in effect, to a derogation from the states substantive obligations under that article.\n",
              "Such a fundamental departure from the broad reach of the Convention should not be undertaken without clear guidance from Strasbourg as to whether, and in what circumstances, this would be appropriate.\n",
              "It may be noted in this context that the intervener JUSTICE drew attention to article 15 of the Convention in reply to concerns about the practical consequences of finding that soldiers are within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom under article 1.\n",
              "It provides that in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation any High Contracting Party may take measures derogating from its obligations under the Convention to the extent required by the exigencies of the situation.\n",
              "But the phrase threatening the life of the nation suggests that the power to derogate under this article is available only in an exceptional situation of crisis or emergency which affects the whole population and constitutes a threat to the organised life of the community of which the state is composed: Lawless v Ireland (No 3) (1961) 1 EHRR 15, para 28.\n",
              "It will be recalled that in A v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 56, [2005] 2 AC 68 it was held that the Human Rights Act 1998 (Designed Derogation) Order 2001, which had been made to derogate from the right to personal liberty under article 5(1) to enable the appellants to be detained indefinitely without trial, should be quashed.\n",
              "And in R (Al Jedda) v Secretary of State for Defence (JUSTICE intervening) [2007] UKHL 58, [2008] AC 332, para 38, Lord Bingham said that it was hard to think that the conditions of article 15 could ever be met when a state had chosen to conduct an overseas peacekeeping operation, however dangerous the conditions, from which it could withdraw.\n",
              "He also noted that it had not been the practice of states to derogate in situations such as those in Iraq in 2004 and that as subsequent practice in the application of a treaty may, under article 31(3)(b) of the Vienna Convention, be taken into account in interpreting the treaty it seemed proper to regard the power in article 15 as inapplicable.\n",
              "I do not think therefore that it would be right to assume that concern about the practical consequences in situations such as those with which we are dealing in this case can be answered by exercising the power to derogate.\n",
              "The circumstances in which that power can properly be exercised are far removed from those where operations are undertaken overseas with a view to eliminating or controlling threats to the nations security.\n",
              "The jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court shows that there are other ways in which such concerns may be met.\n",
              "The Strasbourg court has repeatedly emphasised that, when it comes to an assessment of the positive obligations that are to be inferred from the application in any given case of the Convention rights, a fair balance must be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole.\n",
              "It has also recognised that there will usually be a wide margin of appreciation if the state is required to strike a balance between private and public interests and Convention rights: Hristozov v Bulgaria (Application Nos 47039/11 and 358/12), given 13 November 2012, paras 118, 124.\n",
              "That was a case about a refusal to authorise an experimental medicinal product which the applicants had wished to be administered to them.\n",
              "But the competition between the interests of the state and those of the individual is no less acute where issues arise about the risk to life of soldiers in the context of military operations conducted on the states behalf.\n",
              "The challenge this court faces when dealing with the Snatch Land Rover claims is to determine where the boundary lies between the two extremes in the circumstances that the armed forces were facing in Iraq in 2005 and 2006.\n",
              "In Gentle, para 19, I said that the proper functioning of an army in a modern democracy includes requiring those who serve in it to undertake the operations for which they have been recruited, trained and equipped, some of which are inherently dangerous, and that the jurisprudence developed from the decision in Soering v United Kingdom (1989) 11 EHRR 439 about decisions taken in this country to send people abroad to places where they face a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment does not apply.\n",
              "The guarantee in the first sentence of article 2(1) is not violated simply by deploying servicemen and women on active service overseas as part of an organised military force which is properly equipped and capable of defending itself, even though the risk of their being killed is inherent in what they are being asked to do.\n",
              "The other side of the coin, as Lord Mance explained in Catherine Smith, para 195, is that there is nothing that makes the Convention impossible or inappropriate of application to the relationship between the state and its armed forces as it exists in relation to overseas operations in matters such as, for example, the adequacy of equipment, planning or training.\n",
              "Lord Rodger recognised in the same case at para 126 that, while a coroner will usually have no basis for considering at the outset that there has been a violation of article 2 where a serviceman or woman has been killed by opposing forces in the course of military operations, new information might be uncovered as the investigation proceeds which does point to a possible violation of the article.\n",
              "He referred to the death of a soldier as a result of friendly fire from other British forces as an extreme example.\n",
              "And, as I said in Catherine Smith, para 105, one must not overlook the fact that there have been many cases where the death of service personnel indicates a systemic or operational failure on the part of the state, ranging from a failure to provide them with the equipment that was needed to protect life on the one hand to mistakes in the way they are deployed due to bad planning or inadequate appreciation of the risks that had to be faced on the other.\n",
              "So failures of that kind ought not to be immune from scrutiny in pursuance of the procedural obligation under article 2 of the Convention.\n",
              "The extent to which the application of the substantive obligation under article 2 to military operations may be held to be impossible or inappropriate will, however, vary according to the context.\n",
              "Military operations conducted in the face of the enemy are inherently unpredictable.\n",
              "There is a fundamental difference between manoeuvres conducted under controlled conditions in the training area which can be accurately planned for, and what happens when troops are deployed on active service in situations over which they do not have complete control.\n",
              "As Lord Rodger observed in Catherine Smith, para 122, the job of members of the armed forces involves their being deployed in situations where, as they well know, opposing forces will be making a determined effort, and using all their resources, to kill and injure them.\n",
              "The best laid plan rarely survives initial contact with the enemy.\n",
              "The best intelligence cannot predict with complete accuracy how the enemy will behave, or what equipment will be needed to meet the tactics and devices that he may use to achieve his own ends.\n",
              "Speed may be essential if the momentum of an attack is to be maintained or to strengthen a line of defence.\n",
              "But lines of communication may become stretched.\n",
              "Situations may develop where it is simply not possible to provide troops in time with all they need to conduct operations with the minimum of casualties.\n",
              "Things tend to look and feel very different on the battlefield from the way they look on such charts and images as those behind the lines may have available to them.\n",
              "A court should be very slow indeed to question operational decisions made on the ground by commanders, whatever their rank or level of seniority.\n",
              "Then there is the issue of procurement.\n",
              "In A v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] 2 AC 68, para 29, Lord Bingham said that the more purely political (in a broad or narrow sense) the question is, the more appropriate it would be for political resolution, and the less likely it is to be an appropriate matter for judicial decision.\n",
              "The allocation of resources to the armed services and as between the different branches of the services, is also a question which is more appropriate for political resolution than it is by a court.\n",
              "Much of the equipment in use by the armed forces today is the product of advanced technology, is extremely sophisticated and comes at a very high price.\n",
              "Procurement depends ultimately on the allocation of resources.\n",
              "This may in turn be influenced as much by political judgment as by the judgment of senior commanders in Whitehall as to what they need for the operations they are asked to carry out.\n",
              "It does not follow from the fact that decisions about procurement are taken remote from the battlefield that they will always be appropriate for review by the courts.\n",
              "This, then, is a field of human activity which the law should enter into with great caution.\n",
              "Various international measures, such as those contained in the 3rd Geneva Convention of 1929 to protect prisoners of war, have been entered into to avoid unnecessary hardship to non combatants.\n",
              "But subjecting the operations of the military while on active service to the close scrutiny that may be practicable and appropriate in the interests of safety in the barrack block or in the training area is an entirely different matter.\n",
              "It risks undermining the ability of a state to defend itself, or its interests, at home or abroad.\n",
              "The world is a dangerous place, and states cannot disable themselves from meeting its challenges.\n",
              "Ultimately democracy itself may be at risk.\n",
              "(b) the Strasbourg authorities\n",
              "Fundamentally, article 2 requires a state to have in place a structure of laws which will help to protect life: Savage v South Essex NHS Trust [2008] UKHL 74, [2009] AC 681, para 19, per Lord Rodger.\n",
              "As he explained, with reference to the European courts discussion of this issue in Osman v United Kingdom (1998) 29 EHRR 245, para 115, the primary duty is to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal law offences backed up by law enforcement machinery.\n",
              "But the states duty goes further than that.\n",
              "It may also imply, in certain well defined circumstances, a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect the lives of those within their jurisdiction.\n",
              "In para 88 of its judgment in Keenan v United Kingdom (2001) 33 EHRR 913, the court began by reciting the high level of duty of the state to put in place effective criminal law sanctions to deter the commission of offences against prisoners.\n",
              "But that was just part of what Lord Rodger described in para 30 of Savage as the tralatician jurisprudence of the court on positive obligations under article 2.\n",
              "The positive duties on the state operate at various levels, as one idea is handed down to another.\n",
              "There is a lower level, but still general, duty on a state to take appropriate measures to secure the health and well being of prisoners or people who are in some form of detention.\n",
              "This in its turn gives rise, at a still lower level, to two general obligations: Savage, para 36; Rabone v Pennine Care NHS Trust (INQUEST and others intervening) [2012] UKSC 2, para 12, per Lord Dyson; neryildiz v Turkey (2004) 41 EHRR 325, para 89.\n",
              "The first is a systemic duty, to put in place a legislative and administrative framework which will make for the effective prevention of the risk to their health and well being or, as it was put in neryildiz, para 89, effective deterrence against threats to the right to life.\n",
              "Depending on the facts, this duty could extend to issues about training and the procurement of equipment before the forces are deployed on operations that will bring them into contact with the enemy.\n",
              "The second, which is also directly in point in this case, is to ensure that, where there is a real and immediate risk to life, preventative operational measures of whatever kind are adopted to safeguard the lives of those involved so far as this is practicable.\n",
              "The Strasbourg court has not had occasion to examine the extent to which article 2(1) offers protection at any level to a states armed forces when engaged in operations such as those that were being conducted in Iraq in 2005 and 2006.\n",
              "But there are some straws in the wind which may offer some guidance.\n",
              "In Engel v The Netherlands (No 1) (1976) 1 EHHR 647, para 54, in a well\n",
              "known passage, the Court said that, when interpreting and applying the rules of the Convention, the court must bear in mind the particular characteristics of military life and its effect on the situation of individual members of the armed forces.\n",
              "That was a case about the preservation of military discipline, as were en v Turkey (Application No 45824/99), given 8 July 2003) and Grigoriades v Greece (1997) 27 EHHR 464, where it was observed at p 8 that the extent of the protection given to members of the armed forces must take account of the characteristics of military life, the nature of the activities they are required to perform and of the risk that they give rise to.\n",
              "These comments, however brief, do seem to make it clear that it would not be compatible with the characteristics of military life to expect the same standard of protection as would be afforded by article 2(1) to civilians who had not undertaken the obligations and risks associated with life in the military.\n",
              "That is plainly so in the context of the exercise of military discipline over members of the armed forces when they are on active service.\n",
              "It is hard to see why servicemen and women should not, as a general rule, be given the same protection against the risk of death or injury by the provision of appropriate training and equipment as members of the police, fire and other emergency services.\n",
              "But it is different when the serviceman or woman moves from recruitment and training to operations on active service, whether at home or overseas.\n",
              "It is here that the national interest requires that the law should accord the widest measure of appreciation to commanders on the ground who have the responsibility of planning for and conducting operations there.\n",
              "This approach receives some support from Stoyanovi v Bulgaria (Application No 42980/04), given 9 November 2010, where an application was made under article 2(1) by the family of a soldier who had died during a parachute exercise.\n",
              "In paras 59 61 the Court examined the difference between the primary positive obligation under that article to establish a framework of laws and procedures to protect life and the obligation to take preventative operational measures to protect the life of an individual which may be imposed by implication, as it was put in Osman v United Kingdom (1998) 29 EHRR 245, para 115, only in certain and well defined circumstances.\n",
              "In para 59, recalling what was said in para 116 of Osman where the allegation was of a failure to take preventive measures where there was a known risk of a real, direct and immediate threat to the life of an individual posed by another individual, the Court said: Subject to considerations as to the difficulties involved in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources, such an obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities and which also conforms with the other rights guaranteed by the Convention.\n",
              "In para 61 it observed that positive obligations will vary in their application depending on the context.\n",
              "Having noted that the case concerned an accident during a military training exercise and that parachute training was inherently dangerous but an ordinary part of military duties, it said: Whenever a state undertakes or organises dangerous activities, or authorises them, it must ensure through a system of rules and through sufficient control that the risk is reduced to a reasonable minimum.\n",
              "If nevertheless damage arises, it will only amount to a breach of the states positive obligations if it was due to insufficient regulations or insufficient control, but not if the damage was caused through the negligent conduct of an individual or the concatenation of unfortunate events.\n",
              "That was a case where the state was in control of the situation, as the accident occurred during a training exercise.\n",
              "It was not claimed that any specific risk to the life of the deceased should have been foreseen in advance, nor was it argued that the legislative and administrative framework was defective in any general or systemic sense: paras 62 63.\n",
              "The whole focus of the courts supervision was on the authorities response to the accident.\n",
              "It was not suggested that there could not have been a breach of the general or systemic duties in such a case.\n",
              "There is, however, a sharp contrast between that situation and operations undertaken in a situation where it was known or could reasonably have been anticipated that troops were at risk of attacks from insurgents by unconventional means such as by the planting of IEDs.\n",
              "Regulation and control of the kind contemplated in Stoyanovi is likely to be very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve on the ground in situations of that kind.\n",
              "Even where those directing operations are remote in place and time from the area in which the troops are operating, great care is needed to avoid imposing a burden on them which is impossible or disproportionate.\n",
              "Another example of the Strasbourg courts concern not to impose a disproportionate and unrealistic obligation on the state is provided by Giuliani and Gaggio v Italy (Application No 23458/02), given 24 March 2011.\n",
              "The applicants in that case complained of the death of their son and brother during demonstrations surrounding the G8 summit in Genoa which had degenerated into violence.\n",
              "The Court held that the Italian authorities did not fail in their obligation to do what could reasonably be expected of them to provide the level of safeguards required during operations potentially involving the use of lethal force.\n",
              "It drew a contrast between dealing with a precise and identifiable target and the maintenance of order in the face of possible disturbances spread over the entire city as regards the extent to which the officers involved could be expected to be highly specialised in dealing with the tasks assigned to them.\n",
              "So too, in the case of the armed forces, a contrast can be drawn between their situation in the training area that can be planned for precisely and that which they are likely to encounter during operations when in contact with the enemy.\n",
              "The same approach is indicated by Finogenov v Russia (Application Nos 18299/03 and 27311/03), given 20 December 2011, para 213, where the Court was prepared to give a margin of appreciation to the domestic authorities, in so far as the military and technical aspects of the situation were concerned, in connection with the storming of a theatre in which many people were held hostage by terrorists, even if with hindsight some of the decisions they took might appear open to doubt.\n",
              "The guidance which I would draw from the Courts jurisprudence in this area is that the court must avoid imposing positive obligations on the state in connection with the planning for and conduct of military operations in situations of armed conflict which are unrealistic or disproportionate.\n",
              "But it must give effect to those obligations where it would be reasonable to expect the individual to be afforded the protection of the article.\n",
              "It will be easy to find that allegations are beyond the reach of article 2 if the decisions that were or ought to have been taken about training, procurement or the conduct of operations were at a high level of command and closely linked to the exercise of political judgment and issues of policy.\n",
              "So too if they relate to things done or not done when those who might be thought to be responsible for avoiding the risk of death or injury to others were actively engaged in direct contact with the enemy.\n",
              "But finding whether there is room for claims to be brought in the middle ground, so that the wide margin of appreciation which must be given to the authorities or to those actively engaged in armed conflict is fully recognised without depriving the article of content, is much more difficult.\n",
              "No hard and fast rules can be laid down.\n",
              "It will require the exercise of judgment.\n",
              "This can only be done in the light of the facts of each case. (c) should the claims be struck out?\n",
              "The circumstances of the Snatch Land Rover cases are not precisely analogous to those of any previous case in which the implied positive obligation under article 2 has been imposed, and the allegations made in each of the claimants particulars of claim (see paras 11 and 12, above) are not identical.\n",
              "This is because the explosion in which Pte Hewett was killed occurred more than six months before that which killed Pte Ellis.\n",
              "The claim in Pte Elliss case concentrates on the provision of what is said, in the light of experience, to have been inadequate equipment and a failure to limit his patrol to vehicles which offered better protection or had been fitted with element A. The claims in Pte Hewetts case are less precise and range more widely.\n",
              "But they too extend to criticism of operational decisions taken by those in charge of the patrols as well as to alleged failures in the provision of appropriate vehicles and equipment in the light of the death of L Cpl Brackenbury in similar circumstances seven weeks previously.\n",
              "I am conscious, however, of the fact that these particulars are no more than the briefest outline of the case that the claimants seek to make.\n",
              "Account should also be taken of the fact that the claims were issued in January 2008, in the case of Pte Hewett, and in February 2009, in the case of Pte Ellis.\n",
              "In both cases this was before the judgment was delivered in Stoyanovi v Bulgaria.\n",
              "The European Court has now provided greater clarity as to the approach that should be taken to claims of this kind, as has the discussion about the distinct elements that are to be found in the positive duty to protect life that is to be found in Savage and Rabone.\n",
              "Some of the failures which the claimants allege appear to be of the systemic kind (see para 68, above).\n",
              "Others are of the operational kind that was described in the Osman case, where there was an implied positive obligation to take preventative operational measures to protect those who were at risk of a real, direct and immediate threat to life.\n",
              "Measures of that kind could extend to procurement decisions taken on the ground about the provision of vehicles and equipment, as well as to decisions about their deployment.\n",
              "How precisely the allegations fit into the structure of the duties implied by the article cannot be determined without knowing more about the facts, bearing in mind that it must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an unrealistic or disproportionate burden on the authorities.\n",
              "The overall aim of the courts procedure must be to achieve fairness, and I think that it would be unfair to the relatives of the deceased to apply too exacting a standard at this stage to the way the claims have been pleaded.\n",
              "The circumstances in which the various decisions were made need to be inquired into before it can be determined with complete confidence whether or not there was a breach of the implied positive obligation.\n",
              "The details which are needed to place those circumstances into their proper context will only emerge if evidence is permitted to be led in support of them.\n",
              "This seems to me to be a classic case where the decision on liability should be deferred until after trial.\n",
              "I agree with Owen J that the procurement issues may give rise to questions that are essentially political in nature but that it is not possible to decide whether this is the case without hearing evidence.\n",
              "He said that there was no sound basis for the allegations that relate to operational decisions made by commanders, and for this reason took a different view as to whether they were within the reach of article 2.\n",
              "But it seems to me that these allegations cannot easily be divorced from the allegations about procurement, and that here too the question as to which side of the line they lie is more appropriate for determination after hearing evidence.\n",
              "Much will depend on where, when and by whom the operational decisions were taken and the choices that were open to them, given the rules and other instructions as to the use of equipment under which at each level of command they were required to operate.\n",
              "I would therefore dismiss the MODs appeal against Owen Js decision,\n",
              "which the Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to consider, that none of these claims should be struck out.\n",
              "The claimants are, however, on notice that the trial judge will be expected to follow the guidance set out in this judgment as to the very wide measure of discretion which must be accorded to those who were responsible on the ground for the planning and conduct of the operations during which these soldiers lost their lives and also to the way issues as to procurement too should be approached.\n",
              "It is far from clear that they will be able to show that the implied positive obligation under article 2(1) of the Convention to take preventative operational measures was breached in either case. III.\n",
              "Combat immunity\n",
              "(a) background\n",
              "The Challenger claims proceed on the basis that there is no common law liability for negligence in respect of acts or omissions on the part of those who are actually engaged in armed combat.\n",
              "So it has not been suggested that Lt Pinkstone or anyone else in the Black Watch battle group was negligent.\n",
              "Nor, as his decision to fire was taken during combat, would it have been appropriate to do so.\n",
              "The Challenger claimants concentrate instead on an alleged failure to ensure that the claimants tank and the tanks of the battle group that fired on it were properly equipped with technology and equipment that would have prevented the incident, and an alleged failure to ensure that soldiers were provided with adequate recognition training before they were deployed and also in theatre.\n",
              "Their case is founded entirely on failings in training and procurement.\n",
              "The Ellis claim at common law also raises issues about procurement.\n",
              "The MOD invokes in reply the doctrine of combat immunity, which it says should be given a sufficiently broad scope to cover all acts or omissions that are alleged to have caused death or injury in the course of combat operations.\n",
              "It is plain that the effect of the doctrine, if it applies, would be to remove the issue of liability for negligence from the jurisdiction of the court altogether.\n",
              "But the MOD also submits that, if the court does have jurisdiction, it would not be fair, just or reasonable to impose a duty of care on it to protect the soldiers in such circumstances against death or injury.\n",
              "The justification for these arguments is the same, whichever of the two formulations is adopted.\n",
              "It is that the interests of the state must prevail over the interests of the individual.\n",
              "As Mr Eadie QC for the MOD put it, the fair, just and reasonable test chimes with the doctrine of combat immunity.\n",
              "His appeal against the Court of Appeals decision that the negligence claims should not be struck out was directed primarily to that doctrine.\n",
              "This may be considered to be an application to given facts of the test as to what is fair, just and reasonable.\n",
              "But the structure of the law is important and combat immunity is best thought of as a rule, because once a case falls within it no further thought is needed to determine the question whether a duty of care was owed to the claimant.\n",
              "The scope of this rule deserves attention as a separate issue in its own right.\n",
              "(b) the authorities\n",
              "Combat immunity made its first appearance in Shaw Savill & Albion Co Ltd v Commonwealth (1940) 66 CLR 344.\n",
              "A collision had occurred between HMAS Adelaide and a civilian vessel, the MV Coptic.\n",
              "It took place on 3 December 1940 while the civilian vessel was on a voyage from Brisbane to Sydney.\n",
              "The owners of the civilian vessel claimed that the collision had been caused by negligence on the part of the naval authorities and sought damages.\n",
              "The High Court was adjudicating on the plaintiffs demurrer to the defence and a strike out summons by the Commonwealth.\n",
              "The defence was that, while in the course of actual operations against the enemy, the forces of the Crown are under no duty of care to avoid loss or damage to private individuals.\n",
              "Both applications were dismissed and the case proceeded to trial.\n",
              "The Commonwealth was ultimately found liable on the ground of the captains fault in his navigation of the Adelaide: see Attorney General (New South Wales) v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd (1952) 85 CLR 237, 252 per Dixon CJ.\n",
              "Dixon J, with whom Rich ACJ and McTiernan J agreed, said in the demurrer proceedings at p 361 that it could hardly be maintained that during an actual engagement with the enemy the navigating officer of a ship of war was under a common law duty to avoid harm to such non combatant ships as might appear in the theatre of operations: To concede that any civil liability can rest upon a member of the armed forces for supposedly negligent acts or omissions in the course of an actual engagement with the enemy is opposed alike to reason and to policy.\n",
              "But the principle cannot be limited to the presence of the enemy or to occasions when contact with the enemy has been established.\n",
              "Warfare perhaps never did admit of such a distinction, but now it would be quite absurd.\n",
              "The development of the speed of ships and the range of guns were enough to show it to be an impracticable refinement, but it has been put out of question by the bomber, the submarine and the floating mine.\n",
              "The principle must extend to all active operations against the enemy.\n",
              "At p 362 he acknowledged that it might not be easy under conditions of modern warfare to say in a given case upon which side of the line an act or omission falls.\n",
              "But the uniform tendency of the law had been to concede to the armed forces complete legal freedom in the field, that is to say in the course of active operations against the enemy, so that the application of private law by the ordinary courts may end where the active use of arms begins.\n",
              "Starke J said at pp 355 356 that acts done in the course of operations of war are not justiciable and that this had been decided by Ex P D F Marais [1902] AC 109, where the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council applied the test of whether actual war was raging at the time of the incident.\n",
              "In Groves v Commonwealth (1982) 150 CLR 113, para 3 Gibbs CJ said that he had no difficulty in accepting the correctness of what was said by Dixon J: To hold that there is no civil liability for injury caused by negligence of persons in the course of an actual engagement with the enemy seems to me to accord with common sense and sound policy.\n",
              "In Mulcahy v Ministry of Defence [1996] QB 732 Neill LJ said at p 746 that it seemed to have been recognised in the Australian cases that warlike activities fell into a special category.\n",
              "He concluded at p 748 that an English court should approach a claim of negligence by a soldier who was injured while a gun of whose team he was a member was fired into Iraq during the first Iraq war in the same way as in the High Court of Australia did in the Shaw Savill case.\n",
              "At pp 749 750 he examined what the position would have been, in the absence of the Australian cases, as to whether it would have been fair, just or reasonable to impose a duty of care on one soldier in his conduct to another when engaging the enemy during hostilities.\n",
              "Echoing the words of Gibbs CJ in Groves, he reached the same conclusion, as there was no duty on the defendants in battle conditions to maintain a safe system of work.\n",
              "Sir Iain Glidewell said at p 751 that at common law one soldier does not owe a duty of care to another member of the armed forces when engaging the enemy in the course of hostilities.\n",
              "In his judgment in this case, at para 93, Owen J referred to his judgment in\n",
              "Multiple Claimants v The Ministry of Defence [2003] EWHC 1134 (QB) in which he drew from the cases the proposition that the immunity is not limited to the presence of the enemy or the occasions when contact with the enemy has been established.\n",
              "It extends to all active operations against the enemy in which service personnel are exposed to attack or the threat of attack, including the planning and preparation for the operations in which the armed forces may come under attack or meet armed resistance.\n",
              "He qualified the latter part of this proposition by saying that the extension of the immunity to the planning of and preparation for military operations applied to the planning of and preparation for the operations in which injury was sustained, and not to the planning and preparation in general for possible unidentified further operations.\n",
              "(c) discussion: combat immunity\n",
              "There is not much by way of close reasoning in Shaw Savill and Groves, apart from assertions that where combat immunity applies the doctrine is justified by reason and policy.\n",
              "But the doctrine itself, as explained in Mulcahy, is not in doubt.\n",
              "The question is as to the extent of the immunity.\n",
              "With great respect, I doubt the soundness of the extension of it that in the Multiple Claimants case Owen J drew from the very few cases on this topic.\n",
              "They included Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate [1965] AC 75, where the House held that the destruction of oil installations to avoid their falling into the hands of the enemy did not fall into the category of damage done during the course of battle.\n",
              "That was a very unusual case, which does not really bear on the issue we have to decide.\n",
              "It seems to me that the extension of the immunity to the planning of and preparation for the operations in which injury was sustained that the judge seems to have favoured is too loosely expressed.\n",
              "It could include steps taken far away in place and time from those operations themselves, to which the application of the doctrine as a particular application of what is just, fair and reasonable would be at the very least questionable.\n",
              "Such an extension would also go beyond the situations to which the immunity has so far been applied.\n",
              "In Bici v Ministry of Defence [2004] EWHC 786 (QB), para 90, Elias J noted that combat immunity was exceptionally a defence to the government, and to individuals too, who take action in the course of actual or imminent armed conflict and cause damage to property or death or injury to fellow soldiers or civilians.\n",
              "It was an exception to the principle that was established in Entick v Carrington (1765) 19 State Tr 1029 that the executive cannot simply rely on the interests of the state as a justification for the commission of wrongs.\n",
              "In his opinion the scope of the immunity should be construed narrowly.\n",
              "That approach seems to me to be amply justified by the authorities.\n",
              "The Challenger claims are about alleged failures in training, including pre deployment and in theatre training, and the provision of technology and equipment.\n",
              "They are directed to things that the claimants say should have been done long before the soldiers crossed the start line at the commencement of hostilities.\n",
              "The equipment referred to consists of target identity devices to provide automatic confirmation as to whether a vehicle is a friend or a foe, and situation awareness equipment that would permit tank crews to locate their position and direction of sight accurately.\n",
              "The claim is that, if the Challenger II tanks that were involved in this incident had been provided with this equipment before they went into action, the claimants tank would not have been fired on.\n",
              "The training referred to is described as recognition training.\n",
              "It is said that this should have been provided pre deployment and in theatre.\n",
              "Here too the essence of the claim is that these steps should have been taken before the commencement of hostilities.\n",
              "The claimants are careful to avoid any criticism of the actions of the men who were actually engaged in armed combat at the time of the incident.\n",
              "The question which these claims raise is whether the doctrine of combat immunity should be extended from actual or imminent armed conflict to failures at that earlier stage.\n",
              "I would answer it by adopting Elias Js point, with which Owen J agreed in para 99 of his judgment in this case, that the doctrine should be narrowly construed.\n",
              "To apply the doctrine of combat immunity to these claims would involve an extension of that doctrine beyond the cases to which it has previously been applied.\n",
              "That in itself suggests that it should not be permitted.\n",
              "I can find nothing in these cases to suggest that the doctrine extends that far.\n",
              "In the Shaw Savill case the argument for the Commonwealth at the demurrer stage was that at the time of the collision the warship was engaged in active naval operations against the enemy, that those operations were urgently required and necessary for the safety of the realm and that the national emergency called for the taking of the measures that the warship adopted.\n",
              "Both vessels were said to have been proceeding without any navigation or other lights, in pursuance of instructions from the Australian naval authorities which had been authorised to give them as part of the Crowns function of waging war by sea and protecting vessels from enemy action.\n",
              "It was not said where the enemy were, or what exactly the warship was doing when the collision occurred.\n",
              "But the phrase active naval operations against the enemy makes the point that it was assumed that it occurred during, and not before, the vessels engagement in those operations.\n",
              "The fact that the Commonwealth was ultimately found liable at trial suggests that the judge found that at the material time the warship was not, after all, engaged in actual operations against the enemy.\n",
              "The accident in Mulcahys case occurred while the gun was being fired into Iraq during, and not before, the actual engagement with the enemy.\n",
              "Then there is the point that, as was noted in Jones v Kaney [2011] UKSC 13, [2011] 2 AC 398, paras 108 and 161, any extension of an immunity needs to be justified.\n",
              "It has to be shown to be necessary.\n",
              "Starke J observed in the Shaw Savill case at p 354 that not every warlike operation done in time of war is an operation or an act of war.\n",
              "It is to operations or acts of war only that the doctrine extends, on the ground that the armed forces must be free to conduct such operations without the control or interference of the courts of law.\n",
              "As Dixon J said in the same case at p 361, no one can imagine a court undertaking the trial of an issue as to whether a soldier on the field of battle or a sailor fighting on his ship might reasonably be more careful to avoid causing civil loss or damage.\n",
              "The principle, as he described it, is not limited to acts or omissions in the course of an actual engagement with the enemy.\n",
              "It extends to all active operations against the enemy.\n",
              "While in the course of actually operating against the enemy, the armed forces are under no duty of care to avoid causing loss or damage to those who may be affected by what they do.\n",
              "But, as Dixon J also said at p 362, there is a real distinction between actual operations against the enemy and other activities of the combatant services in time of war.\n",
              "He referred by way of example to a warship proceeding to her anchorage or manoeuvring among other ships in a harbour.\n",
              "At that stage no reason was apparent for treating her officers as under no civil duty of care, remembering always that the standard of care is that which is reasonable in the circumstances.\n",
              "The same point can be made about the time when the failures are alleged to have taken place in the Challenger claimants case.\n",
              "At the stage when men are being trained, whether pre deployment or in theatre, or decisions are being made about the fitting of equipment to tanks or other fighting vehicles, there is time to think things through, to plan and to exercise judgment.\n",
              "These activities are sufficiently far removed from the pressures and risks of active operations against the enemy for it to not to be unreasonable to expect a duty of care to be exercised, so long as the standard of care that is imposed has regard to the nature of these activities and to their circumstances.\n",
              "For this reason I would hold that the Challenger claims are not within the scope of the doctrine, that they should not be struck out on this ground and that the MOD should not be permitted, in the case of these claims, to maintain this argument.\n",
              "The Ellis common law claim relates to a different phase of the United Kingdoms engagement in Iraq, but it was a phase during which there was a constant threat of enemy action by insurgents which was liable to cause death or injury.\n",
              "These claims are less obviously directed to things done away from the theatre in which Pte Ellis was engaged at the time of his death: see para 12, above.\n",
              "Their wording suggests that at least some of the failures alleged may have been due to decisions taken by local commanders during active operations on the ground.\n",
              "If that was the situation, it may be open to argument that these claims are within the doctrine.\n",
              "As Moses LJ recognised in the Court of Appeal, para 63, factual issues of that kind must be left for determination at the trial.\n",
              "The information that would be needed for a decision either way is lacking at this stage.\n",
              "As in the case of their claims under article 2 of the Convention, the details that are needed to place the claims in context will only emerge if evidence is permitted to be led in support of them.\n",
              "So I would hold that it would be premature for these claims to be struck out on the ground of combat immunity.\n",
              "I would leave this issue open to further argument in the light of the evidence.\n",
              "(d) discussion: fair, just and reasonable\n",
              "Mr Eadie QC also renewed the argument that was advanced below that the common law claims should be struck out on the ground that it would not be fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care at common law to protect against such death or injury as occurred in these cases.\n",
              "He referred, for example, to Van Colle v Chief Constable of Hertfordshire Police [2008] UKHL 50, [2009] AC 225, Brooks v Comr of Police of the Metropolis [2005] UKHL 24, [2005] 1 WLR 1495 and Stovin v Wise [1996] AC 923 in support of this part of his argument.\n",
              "In Brooks, para 30 Lord Steyn affirmed what he described as the core principle in Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [1989] AC 53, where it was held on grounds of public policy that the police did not owe legal duties to victims or witnesses in the performance of their function in keeping the Queens peace: see also Elguzouli Daf v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1995] QB 335, where Lord Steyn held, also on grounds of public policy, that the Crown Prosecution Service did not owe a duty of care to those whom it was prosecuting; and Hughes v National Union of Mineworkers [1991] ICR 669, where May J held that it would be detrimental to the public interest if police officers charged with deploying of other officers in times of serious public disorder were to have to concern themselves with possible negligence claims from their subordinates.\n",
              "These can all be seen as cases where, for reasons of public policy, it was not fair, just or reasonable for the defendant to be under a duty of care to avoid injury.\n",
              "The closest the cases have come to applying that reasoning to cases involving members of the armed forces is Mulcahy v Ministry of Defence [1996] QB 732, where Neill LJ said at p 750 that there was no duty on the defendants in battle conditions to maintain a safe system of work and Sir Iain Glidewell said at p 751 that one soldier does not owe to another a duty of care when engaged in battle conditions.\n",
              "As in the other cases, the question whether a duty should be held not to exist depends on the circumstances on who the potential claimants are and when, where and how they are affected by the defendants acts.\n",
              "The circumstances in which active operations are undertaken by our armed services today vary greatly from theatre to theatre and from operation to operation.\n",
              "They cannot all be grouped under a single umbrella as if they were all open to the same risk, which must of course be avoided, of judicialising warfare.\n",
              "For these reasons, I think that the question whether the claims in this case fall within the exclusion that was recognised in Mulcahy or any extension of it that can be justified on grounds of public policy cannot properly be determined without hearing evidence.\n",
              "In Van Colle, para 58 Lord Bingham said that one would ordinarily be surprised if conduct which violated a fundamental right or freedom of the individual under the Convention did not find a reflection in a body of law as sensitive to human needs as the common law.\n",
              "So Lord Rodgers observation in Catherine Smith, para 126 that there would be reason to believe that the military authorities may have failed in their article 2 duty if a soldier dies as a result of friendly fire from other British forces is capable of being read across as indicating that the question in the case of the Challenger claims is not whether a duty was owed but whether, on the facts, it was breached.\n",
              "Whether the situation in Iraq at the time of the incidents that gave rise to the Ellis claims was comparable to battle conditions when a nation is at war is a matter that also needs to be investigated.\n",
              "It needs to be emphasised, however, that the considerations mentioned in paras 64 66 and 76 81, above in the context of the claims made under article 2 of the Convention are just as relevant in the context of the common law claims.\n",
              "Close attention must be paid to the time when the alleged failures are said to have taken place, and to the circumstances in which and the persons by whom the decisions that gave rise to them were taken.\n",
              "It will be easier to find that the duty of care has been breached where the failure can be attributed to decisions about training or equipment that were taken before deployment, when there was time to assess the risks to life that had to be planned for, than it will be where they are attributable to what was taking place in theatre.\n",
              "The more constrained he is by decisions that have already been taken for reasons of policy at a high level of command beforehand or by the effects of contact with the enemy, the more difficult it will be to find that the decision taker in theatre was at fault.\n",
              "Great care needs to be taken not to subject those responsible for decisions at any level that affect what takes place on the battlefield, or in operations of the kind that were being conducted in Iraq after the end of hostilities, to duties that are unrealistic or excessively burdensome.\n",
              "The sad fact is that, while members of the armed forces on active service can be given some measure of protection against death and injury, the nature of the job they do means that this can never be complete.\n",
              "They deserve our respect because they are willing to face these risks in the national interest, and the law will always attach importance to the protection of life and physical safety.\n",
              "But it is of paramount importance that the work that the armed services do in the national interest should not be impeded by having to prepare for or conduct active operations against the enemy under the threat of litigation if things should go wrong.\n",
              "The court must be especially careful, in their case, to have regard to the public interest, to the unpredictable nature of armed conflict and to the inevitable risks that it gives rise to when it is striking the balance as to what is fair, just and reasonable.\n",
              "Conclusion\n",
              "For these reasons I would allow the Snatch Land Rover claimants appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal that the soldiers in these cases were not within the United Kingdoms jurisdiction for the purposes of article 2 of the Convention at the time of their deaths.\n",
              "I would, however, dismiss the MODs application that the Snatch Land Rover claims should be struck out on the ground that the claims are not within the scope of that article.\n",
              "I would dismiss the MODs application that the Challenger claims should be struck out on the ground of combat immunity and on the ground that it would not be fair, just or reasonable to extend the duty of care to those cases.\n",
              "I would also dismiss the MODs cross appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal to dismiss its application to strike out the Ellis claim based on negligence.\n",
              "LORD MANCE (with whom Lord Wilson agrees)\n",
              "Introduction\n",
              "This first issue is whether soldiers in the British army are within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom when serving both on and off base in Iraq for the purposes of article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n",
              "On this issue, I am in complete agreement with Lord Hope.\n",
              "I have nothing to add to what he says in his paragraphs 17 55.\n",
              "On this basis, this case raises once again for consideration the difficult line or inter relationship between national law and substantive Convention rights, to which I referred in Rabone v Pennine Care NHS Trust [2012] UKSC 2; [2012] 2 AC 72, para 121.\n",
              "It is in general terms clear from Strasbourg jurisprudence that article 2 of the Human Rights Convention includes substantive duties on the part of the state, namely (a) a systems or framework duty, viz to establish a framework which is appropriately protective of life and (b) an operational duty, viz in appropriate circumstances, a positive duty to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk: Watts v United Kingdom (2010) 51 EHRR SE66, para 82.\n",
              "Although the operational duty was said in Osman v United Kingdom (1998) 29 EHRR 245 to apply in certain well defined circumstances, the subsequent recognition of its application in new sets of circumstances (including by this Court in Rabone) leaves its scope uncertain.\n",
              "As Lady Hale notes in Rabone, para 97 99, it is conceivable that the Strasbourg jurisprudence accepts or is moving towards a broad principle that engages article 2 and requires the state to react reasonably in any situation where the state knows or ought to know of a real and immediate threat to human life.\n",
              "It is also unclear how far the two substantive duties are separated, with middle ground between them, or form part of a continuum covering almost every aspect of state activity.\n",
              "In neryildiz v Turkey (2005) 41 EHRR 325, paras 89 90 the Strasbourg court treated the framework duty as indisputably apply[ing] in the particular context of dangerous activities, where special emphasis must be placed on regulations geared to the special features of the activity in question, adding that They must govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks.\n",
              "On the other hand, there are some circumstances in which death occurs as a result of the activities of state agents, but article 2 is not engaged.\n",
              "They include casual errors of judgment or acts of negligence (which I described in R (Catherine Smith) v Oxfordshire Assistant Deputy Coroner [2010] UKSC 29; [2011] 1 AC 1, para 201, as operational as opposed to systematic failures), a principle established in the context of medical negligence.\n",
              "The present appeal concerns the operation and application of the principles of common law negligence and of article 2 in a factual context which is very largely uncharted by previous authority.\n",
              "The right approach is I believe to take first the common law position.\n",
              "A primary aspect of the framework duty on states is to have a legislative and administrative framework appropriately protective of life: neryildiz, para 89, quoted in Rabone, para 12.\n",
              "So article 2 naturally directs attention first to the question whether domestic law provides such a framework, including the recourse to compensation for non pecuniary damages which the Strasbourg court has indicated should in principle be available as part of the range of redress where a state is held responsible for a death: Z v United Kingdom (2001) 34 EHRR 97, para 109.\n",
              "The claims\n",
              "I gratefully adopt Lord Hopes summary of the various claims in paras 9 to 12 of his judgment.\n",
              "Some preliminary observations may be made.\n",
              "First, although the Challenger claims are based only on allegations of lack of technology, equipment and/or training, the Particulars of Claim alone show that the factual circumstances of these sad deaths would require examination and that failings on the ground of those with command over the firing tank are in fact held directly responsible for such deaths.\n",
              "In particular, it is alleged that Major McDuff under whose command the firing tank fell was told of the presence of the tanks subsequently fired upon and had such tanks visually identified to him, that he was shown, but refused to accept, the boundaries of responsibility marked on a map which had been given to such tanks and that he failed to communicate any of this information to anyone, with the result that, some 12 hours later, the firing tank wrongly identified the tanks fired on as enemy.\n",
              "Second, the particulars relied upon in Mrs Smiths claim under article 2 include both decisions or omissions on the ground and equipment and tactical decisions at a higher level.\n",
              "Third, the particulars relied upon in the Ellis claims in negligence and/or under article 2 relate mainly at least to equipment and tactical decisions at a higher level (although they also embrace allegations as to what equipment should have been used if available).\n",
              "As pleaded, the complaint regarding the decision to deploy Snatch Land Rovers on the patrol might be read as a complaint about a decision made on the ground.\n",
              "But their case (para 188) explains that it relates to a decision made well away from the heat of battle at a time when the decision maker was neither under attack nor threat of attack.\n",
              "It did not form part of the planning of this particular patrol.\n",
              "Common law\n",
              "The questions arising are (i) the existence and scope of any common law responsibility on the part of the state towards its soldiers, in particular in respect of deaths in active service and (ii) the nature and scope of any common law doctrine of combat immunity.\n",
              "The claimants starting point is that the state owes to its soldiers a general duty to take appropriate measures to secure their safety, like that owed by any other employer, and that it must also answer vicariously for any breach of duty by one soldier killing or injuring another.\n",
              "It is only therefore by virtue of some exceptional immunity that the state can escape liability for breach of any such duty, and the only principle giving any such immunity is a limited principle of combat immunity.\n",
              "That the Crown is in tort generally in the same position as any employer follows from s.2 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, providing Liability of the Crown in tort. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Crown shall be subject to all those liabilities in tort to which, if it were a private person of full age and capacity, it would be subject: (a) in respect of torts committed by its servants or agents; (b) in respect of any breach of those duties which a person owes to his servants or agents at common law by reason of being their employer; and (c) in respect of any breach of the duties attaching at common law to the ownership, occupation, possession or control of property: Provided that no proceedings shall lie against the Crown by virtue of paragraph (a) of this subsection in respect of any act or omission of a servant or agent of the Crown unless the act or omission would apart from the provisions of this Act have given rise to a cause of action in tort against that servant or agent or his estate.\n",
              "However, there is authority that where actual war is raging acts done by the military authorities are not justiciable by the ordinary tribunals: Ex p Marais [1902] AC 109, 114.\n",
              "That was a case of alleged wrongful detention where the Privy Council declared that the principle applied where martial law had been declared, even though the military commander had allowed ordinary courts, before which the claimant might have been brought, to continue in operation.\n",
              "In Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate [1965] AC 75, Lord Reid recognised (at p 110) an exception (to the Crowns liability to pay compensation for property seized or destroyed) in relation to battle damage consisting of accidental or deliberate damage done in the course of fighting operations.\n",
              "In Shaw Savill & Albion Co Ltd v Commonwealth (1940) 66 CLR 344, Ex p Marais was cited by Starke and Williams JJ, but all the members of the High Court also assimilated the question of justiciability with the question whether the state owed a legal duty to take care in the particular circumstances.\n",
              "Starke J stated that it is for the court to determine whether a state of war exists and whether the matters complained of were done or omitted in the conduct of an operation or act of war.\n",
              "He added (consistently with Ex p Marais) that the immunity arising from conduct of war cannot be confined to the theatre of operations where combatants are actively engaged: it must extend, in modern times, to all theatres in which action on the part of the Kings enemies is imminent.\n",
              "In terms of the modern law of tort, the right analysis is, I consider, that combat immunity is not so much an entirely separate principle as the result of a general conclusion that it is not fair, just or reasonable to regard the Crown or its officers, soldiers or agents as under a duty of care to avoid injury or death in their acts or omissions in the conduct of an active military operation or act of war.\n",
              "That is how the matter was seen in Mulcahy v Ministry of Defence [1996] QB 732.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal there, rightly in my view, followed the approach in Shaw Savill in holding that a gun commander firing live rounds into Iraq during the first Gulf War in 1991 owed the claimant, a serving soldier in the same team, no duty of care for breach of which the Ministry could be held vicariously liable.\n",
              "It held equally that the Ministry itself owed the claimant no duty to maintain a safe system of work.\n",
              "Among the points considered in Mulcahy was whether the repeal of the immunity in tort formerly provided by section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, subject to the right (never yet utilised) to revive section 10 for all or limited purposes under s.2 of the Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987 bore on the existence or scope of any doctrine of combat immunity.\n",
              "Neill LJ held it did not, because it was still necessary to consider the common law position.\n",
              "I agree.\n",
              "In Bici v Ministry of Defence [2004] EWHC 786 (QB), concerning the killing of two civilians by British soldiers during the course of peace keeping operations in Kosovo, Elias J treated separately the doctrine of combat immunity and the question whether there existed a duty of care, viewing the former as an exclusion of justiciability and so as a doctrine to be strictly confined on constitutional grounds.\n",
              "But on that basis it was still necessary to consider whether any duty of care existed.\n",
              "Elias J held it did, because the case involved the single question whether the soldiers were justified in firing on the civilians, and there was no basis for concluding that they did not owe a duty of care in doing so: Troops he said (para 104) frequently have to carry out difficult and sensitive peace keeping functions, such as in Northern Ireland, whilst still being subject to common law duties of care.\n",
              "The difficulties of their task are reflected in the standard of the duty rather than by denying its applicability.\n",
              "As Lord Hope has noted, the cases on combat immunity are focused on acts or omissions occurring and causing injury or death in the course of hostilities.\n",
              "In the present case the Challenger claimants are careful to put their case in a way which relies solely on allegedly negligent conduct occurring prior to and distant from the actual hostilities, and involving failures, in Whitehall or elsewhere, properly to equip and train the soldiers sent to fight in Iraq.\n",
              "The same applies, at least for the most part, to the Ellis claims.\n",
              "The question is whether the state, or indeed those of its officers responsible for procurement and training decisions, owe any duty of care in respect of injury or death in the course of combat operations allegedly attributable to their negligence in the performance of such responsibility.\n",
              "This is a question of public policy about the answer to which Lord Rodger (at para 127), with whom Lord Walker expressly agreed (at para 131), can, I think, have had no doubt in R (Catherine Smith) v Oxfordshire Assistant Deputy Coroner [2010] UKSC 29, [2011] 1 AC 1.\n",
              "Although they were addressing explicitly the position under article 2, they cannot have thought that their remarks were or could be made irrelevant simply be reformulating a claim in negligence.\n",
              "It is not difficult to identify situations in which the common law has concluded on policy grounds that no duty of care should exist.\n",
              "I agree with all that Lord Carnwath has said in this connection in paras 161 to 175 of his judgment.\n",
              "In Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [1989] AC 53, the House held that the police had owed no enforceable duty of care with respect to the last victim of the Yorkshire Ripper, properly to investigate the crimes committed by the Yorkshire Ripper before the murder of, and so to save the life of, the last victim.\n",
              "Lord Keith said, at p 63: From time to time they [the police] make mistakes in the exercise of that function, but it is not to be doubted that they apply their best endeavours to the performance of it.\n",
              "In some instances the imposition of liability may lead to the exercise of a function being carried on in a detrimentally defensive frame of mind.\n",
              "The possibility of this happening in relation to the investigative operations of the police cannot be excluded.\n",
              "Further it would be reasonable to expect that if potential liability were to be imposed it would be not uncommon for actions to be raised against police forces on the ground that they had failed to catch some criminal as soon as they might have done, with the result that he went on to commit further crimes.\n",
              "While some such actions might involve allegations of a simple and straightforward type of failure for example that a police officer negligently tripped and fell while pursuing a burglar others would be likely to enter deeply into the general nature of a police investigation, as indeed the present action would seek to do.\n",
              "The manner of conduct of such an investigation must necessarily involve a variety of decisions to be made on matters of policy and discretion, for example as to which particular line of inquiry is most advantageously to be pursued and what is the most advantageous way to deploy the available resources.\n",
              "Many such decisions would not be regarded by the courts as appropriate to be called in question, yet elaborate investigation of the facts might be necessary to ascertain whether or not this was so.\n",
              "A great deal of police time, trouble and expense might be expected to have to be put into the preparation of the defence to the action and the attendance of witnesses at the trial.\n",
              "The result would be a significant diversion of police manpower and attention from their most important function, that of the suppression of crime.\n",
              "Closed investigations would require to be reopened and retraversed, not with the object of bringing any criminal to justice but to ascertain whether or not they had been competently conducted.\n",
              "In Brooks v Comr of Police of the Metropolis [2005] 1 WLR 1495, the House applied similar reasoning when holding that the police have no duty of care not to cause by positive acts or omissions harm to victims of serious crime, or witnesses to serious crime, with whom they have contact.\n",
              "Lord Steyn said (para 30): It is, of course, desirable that police officers should treat victims and witnesses properly and with respect: compare the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/645).\n",
              "But to convert that ethical value into general legal duties of care on the police towards victims and witnesses would be going too far.\n",
              "The prime function of the police is the preservation of the Queen's peace.\n",
              "The police must concentrate on preventing the commission of crime; protecting life and property; and apprehending criminals and preserving evidence: .\n",
              "A retreat from the principle in Hill's case would have detrimental effects for law enforcement.\n",
              "Whilst focusing on investigating crime, and the arrest of suspects, police officers would in practice be required to ensure that in every contact with a potential witness or a potential victim time and resources were deployed to avoid the risk of causing harm or offence.\n",
              "Such legal duties would tend to inhibit a robust approach in assessing a person as a possible suspect, witness or victim.\n",
              "By placing general duties of care on the police to victims and witnesses the police's ability to perform their public functions in the interests of the community, fearlessly and with despatch, would be impeded.\n",
              "It would, as was recognised in Hill's case, be bound to lead to an unduly defensive approach in combating crime.\n",
              "Van Colle v Chief Constable of the Hertfordshire Police (Secretary of State for the Home Department intervening) [2008] UKSC 50, [2009] AC 225 is a further case in which there was in Lord Hopes words a highly regrettable failure to react to a prolonged campaign by Jeffrey threatening the use of extreme criminal violence against Mr Smith, which in the event did culminate in Jeffrey attacking Mr Smith and very severely injuring him.\n",
              "The House again applied the approach in Hill and Brooks in concluding that there was no actionable duty of care.\n",
              "In all these cases the existence of a duty of care was negatived, although it could not be said that the police action or inaction occurred in the heat of the moment and the failings occurred over considerable periods when the police had the opportunity to think about and investigate the position and take protective measures.\n",
              "In Multiple Claimants v Ministry of Defence [2003] EWHC 1134 (QB), it was claimed that the Ministry was in breach of a duty of care to provide service personnel with a safe system of work.\n",
              "Owen J considered (para 2.C.16) that In aggressive operations the objective will be defeat of the enemy; in defensive operations the successful repulse of the enemy.\n",
              "In the planning of and preparation for such operations the interests of service personnel must be subordinate to the attainment of the military objective.\n",
              "In my judgment the military cannot be constrained by the imposition of civil liability in the planning of and preparation for such operations any more than in their execution.\n",
              "The planning of and preparation for military operations will include decisions as to the deployment of resources.\n",
              "On that basis, he dismissed a claim that the Ministry had failed to make proper arrangements for psychiatric support in combat on the basis that Decisions as to the deployment of medical resources in operations in which service personnel may engage in hostilities fall within the combat immunity . (para 10.12).\n",
              "However, he disagreed with the Ministrys more extended submission that no cause of action can arise in relation to injury sustained in combat irrespective of whether the acts or omissions to which such injury is attributable fall within the combat immunity (para 2.C.18).\n",
              "He reiterated his view on this point in his judgment at first instance in the present cases concerning the Challenger and Ellis claims.\n",
              "Mr Eadie QC takes issue with Owen J on the point.\n",
              "However, it was explained by Owen J with an example which suggests that he had in mind a relatively narrow situation not presently relevant.\n",
              "The explanation was in these terms: If the restriction to the duty of care does not arise on the facts, and a claimant is able to demonstrate breach of duty resulting in injury and consequential loss and damage, it is immaterial that the injury was sustained in the course of combat.\n",
              "The question with regard to the injury is then simply one of causation; is it attributable to the breach of duty? The point can be illustrated by reference to the claimants' contention that the MoD was under a duty to devise and implement a system for screening recruits so as, and I paraphrase, to eliminate those vulnerable to stress, and that as a result of breach of that duty recruits who should have been rejected were enlisted, and subsequently sustained psychiatric injury when exposed to the trauma of battle.\n",
              "If that contention is well founded, it will obviously not be open to the MoD to argue that the combat immunity applies to the relevant acts or omissions.\n",
              "The injury will have been sustained in combat; but the exposure to stress in combat is simply the mechanism by which the breach causes injury.\n",
              "In considering the Challenger claims and the Ellis claim for negligence, Owen J referred to his previous decision in Multiple Claimants as well as to Elias Js decision in Bici.\n",
              "He accepted the latter as standing for the proposition that any exception on grounds of combat immunity should be narrowly construed.\n",
              "He confined the extension of the doctrine of combat immunity, recognised in Multiple Claimants, to the planning and preparation of the particular operations in which injury was sustained, as opposed to planning and preparation made . in general for possible unidentified further military operations (para 94).\n",
              "He was not persuaded that the fact that the equipment claims were likely to give rise to issues of procurement and allocation of resources demonstrated conclusively that it would not be fair, just and reasonable to impose the duties of care for which the claimants contend (para 107).\n",
              "He was not persuaded that either the equipment or the claims based on lack of pre deployment training had no real prospect of success.\n",
              "He thought that different considerations might apply to the claims so far as based on lack of in theatre training, but that this issue would be better determined by the trial judge.\n",
              "He struck out the Ellis claim for negligence in para 26.1 (failure to limit patrols to other vehicles) as falling squarely within combat immunity.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal upheld Owen Js conclusion that the equipment and training claims arguably fall outwith the scope of combat immunity, and also allowed the appeal in respect of para 26.1.\n",
              "Three points arise.\n",
              "First, in my opinion, the decisions below underestimate the inevitable inter linking of issues relating to the supply of technology and equipment and to training for active service with decisions taken on the ground during active service.\n",
              "As noted in para 110 above, it is not possible to consider the Challenger claims without considering the conduct of those on the ground.\n",
              "If it were suggested, as might be possible, that the real cause of the incident was the failings of a local commander, the court would, on the claimants case, find itself having to adjudicate on this suggestion in order to establish whether there was any relevant causative failure regarding the prior supply of equipment or training.\n",
              "As Lord Hope notes (para 91), the claimants have, quite naturally, been careful not to make any criticism of those actually engaged on the ground.\n",
              "But that indicates, rather than resolves, the problem.\n",
              "The proper attribution of responsibility cannot depend upon how a claimant frames his case.\n",
              "The Ministry of Defence could itself advance a case that the real cause was not the fault of someone responsible for procurement, but of someone on the ground.\n",
              "In any event, as the present pleadings show, all the facts would be laid before the court, which would have to decide upon causation looking at them as a whole.\n",
              "Allegations about procurement cannot in the case of the Challenger claims be divorced from consideration of the conduct of those using the equipment on the ground.\n",
              "Lord Hope recognises this in paragraph 80, but draws the opposite conclusion to that which I would draw.\n",
              "He considers that all such circumstances must be evaluated with a view to striking a balance between competing considerations (paras 61, 78 80 and 98 99).\n",
              "I would conclude the opposite that all such circumstances are inter related and essentially non justiciable.\n",
              "Second, Mr Hermer QC for the Challenger claimants accepts that tactical decisions, wherever taken, are not actionable.\n",
              "Mr Hermer must on any view be correct, I consider, on this point.\n",
              "But, if so, it opens the question in relation to the Snatch Land Rover claim by Ms and Mrs Ellis whether a complaint of failure to supply a better armoured or equipped vehicle is not really a complaint about tactics. (In contrast to Mr Hermer, Mr Weir QC for the Smith and Ellis claimants would confine combat immunity so narrowly that it could not embrace in the case of the Ellis claimants either a question why allegedly available equipment (Element A) was not fitted to Private Elliss Snatch Land Rover on the day of the casualty or a question why the patrol to the Iraqi police station was not delayed a day or two to enable it to be fitted.)\n",
              "Third, both in that connection and more widely, I consider that Owen J was clearly right to conclude in Multiple Claimants that the military cannot be constrained by the imposition of civil liability in the planning of and preparation for such operations any more than in their execution.\n",
              "The planning of and preparation for military operations will include decisions as to the deployment of resources.\n",
              "I would also refer to cautionary words of Lord Keith in Rowling v Takaro Properties Ltd [1988] AC 473, 502D F: The third [matter] is the danger of overkill.\n",
              "It is to be hoped that, as a general rule, imposition of liability for negligence will lead to a higher standard of care in the performance of the relevant type of act; but sometimes not only may this not be so, but the imposition of liability may even lead to harmful consequences.\n",
              "In other words, the cure may be worse than the disease.\n",
              "The claims that the Ministry failed to ensure that the army was better equipped and trained involve policy considerations of the same character as those which were decisive in Hill, Brooks and Van Colle.\n",
              "They raise issues of huge potential width, which would involve courts in examining procurement and training policy and priorities over years, with senior officers, civil servants and ministers having to be called and to explain their decisions long after they were made.\n",
              "Policy decisions concerning military procurement and training involve predictions as to uncertain future needs, the assessment and balancing of multiple risks and the setting of difficult priorities for the often enormous expenditure required, to be made out of limited resources.\n",
              "They are often highly controversial and not infrequently political in their nature.\n",
              "These may well also be influenced by considerations of national security which cannot openly be disclosed or discussed.\n",
              "Lord Rodger summarised the position in relation to responsibility, accountability and investigation in Catherine Smith (para 127) in terms with which, as I have said, Lord Walker agreed, as I also do: Once it is established, say, that a soldier died because the blast from a roadside bomb penetrated the armour plating on his vehicle, it may well be inferred that he would not have died if the plating had been stronger.\n",
              "And that simple fact may be worth pointing out as a possible guide for the future.\n",
              "But questions, say, as to whether it would have been feasible to fit stronger protection, or as to why the particular vehicles were used in the operation or campaign, or as to why those vehicles, as opposed to vehicles with stronger protection, were originally purchased by the Ministry of Defence, or as to whether it would have been better to have more helicopters available etc, all raise issues which are essentially political rather than legal.\n",
              "That being so, a curious aspect of counsel's submissions before this court was the complete absence of any reference to Parliament as the forum in which such matters should be raised and debated and in which ministers should be held responsible.\n",
              "Of course, in consequence of pressure brought to bear by Parliament, the government might set up an independent inquiry with wide terms of reference to look into all aspects of a situation, including the political aspects.\n",
              "Also in Catherine Smith Lord Brown at para 146 asked rhetorically: Is it really to be suggested that even outside the area of the Council of Europe Strasbourg will scrutinise a contracting state's planning, control and execution of military operations to decide whether the state's own forces have been subjected to excessive risk (risk, that is, which is disproportionate to the objective sought) ? May Strasbourg say that a different strategy or tactic should have been adopted perhaps the use of airpower or longer range weaponry to minimise the risk to ground troops notwithstanding that this might lead to higher civilian casualties? The question was asked in the context of jurisdiction, but, jurisdiction having been established under article 1, both the question and Lord Browns evident scepticism remain relevant.\n",
              "The claimants case is that during or after any war any injured soldier or the relatives or dependants of any soldier killed in combat could sue the state for alleged failures in the preparation or equipping of the armed forces for combat.\n",
              "Logically, if that is so, then a soldier might, even during the war, complain that his or her equipment or training was inadequate and that it would be a breach of the states common law duty of care and/or duties under the Human Rights Convention even to order him or her to go into combat with it.\n",
              "If domestic legislation compelled this, then the soldier could seek relief in the Strasbourg court maybe even interim relief prohibiting the further use or giving of orders to use the allegedly defective equipment.\n",
              "One may also recall the facts of R v Jones (Margaret) [2006] UKHL 16; [2007] 1 AC 136, where protestors sought to disrupt Fairford Airbase in order to prevent intervention in Iraq, and pleaded in defence that they were preventing the international crime of aggression.\n",
              "Pointing to defective equipment and seeking to ban its use could have a considerable disruptive effect.\n",
              "Not only would there be a huge potential diversion of time and effort in litigation of such issues in an area of essential national interest (whether before, during or after hostilities).\n",
              "There must be risks that the threat of exhaustive civil litigation following any active military operation would affect decision making and lead to a defensive approach, both at the general procurement and strategic stages and at the tactical and combat stages when equipment was being deployed.\n",
              "The duties of care owed by soldiers to civilians during peace keeping operations or by the state to its soldiers in peace are not in issue and raise different considerations.\n",
              "I examined some of the cases which the Strasbourg court has decided in this area in para 196 of my judgment in Catherine Smith.\n",
              "When considering whether a duty of care exists, it is always relevant to ask in what context and to avoid what consequences. (Compare in another branch of the law South Australia Asset Management Corporation v York Montague Ltd [1997] AC 191 and Nykredit Mortgage Bank plc v Edward Erdman Group Ltd (No 2) [1997] 1 WLR 1627.) Equipment should at least be safe and training adequate for peacetime training and activities, and its adequacy in the face of enemy action will not be tested in the same way.\n",
              "But procurement and training decisions and priorities are geared primarily to the needs and risks inherent in active military operations, when enemy activity will be aimed at killing British soldiers in as many unexpected ways as possible.\n",
              "It is after a death or injury occurring in such operations that, as the present cases show, questions can be raised as to whether different technology, equipment or training or different decisions regarding deployment and use of equipment like vehicles might not have made all the difference to the incidence of the death or injury.\n",
              "The relevant question for present purposes is therefore whether the state owed a duty of care to avoid the death or injury during the course of active service which actually occurred.\n",
              "It will often not be difficult with hindsight to point to different decisions that might have been made or preparations made.\n",
              "Would the disaster of Isandlwana have been avoided had the army command equipped Lord Chelmsfords forces with the heliograph? Or was the cause the failure to form a laager? Or the deployment of troops over too wide a perimeter? Or the lack of screwdrivers to open the ammunition boxes quickly enough? And would many disastrous casualties of the First World War have been avoided if the War Office had recognised the significance of the proposal for a tank put to it in 1912, 1914 and 1916 by the Australian engineer Lancelot de Mole of whom a post war Commission on Awards to Inventors said in 1919: We consider that he is entitled to the greatest credit for having made and reduced to practical shape as far back as the year 1912 a very brilliant invention which anticipated and in some respects surpassed that actually put into use in the year 1916.\n",
              "It was this claimant's misfortune and not his fault that his invention was in advance of his time, and failed to be appreciated and was put aside because the occasion for its use had not then arisen.\n",
              "Was the fall of Singapore to numerically inferior forces, with the ensuing slaughter and torture, due to culpable failures to fortify the Malay peninsular or landward side of Singapore or to provide armoured vehicles or aircraft to protect both? Or was it due to failures of military commanders on the ground? Or was it inevitable in the context of what Churchill described as our bitter needs elsewhere?\n",
              "To offer as a panacea in relation to these points the injunction that courts should be very cautious about accepting such claims is to acknowledge the problem, but to offer no real solution.\n",
              "Had it been, the same panacea would have been adopted as the solution by the House in Hill, Brooks and Van Colle.\n",
              "My conclusions do not mean that every death or injury occurring in the course of military conflict falls necessarily outside the scope of any duty of care.\n",
              "There will be deaths and injuries occurring during active service which are unconnected with the risks of active combat or which arise, as Owen J recognised was possible (para 123 above), from breaches of duty independent of active combat.\n",
              "An accident arising from a defect in equipment which could just as well have occurred on Salisbury Plain and owed nothing significant to any risk of war would be an example.\n",
              "Private Smiths sad death in Catherine Smith likewise.\n",
              "I consider that that the Challenger claims, which are only in common law negligence, should be struck out in their entirety on the basis that the state owes no such duty of care as alleged with regard to the provision of technology, equipment or training to avoid death or injury in the course of an active military operation.\n",
              "Similarly, with regard to the Ellis claim in negligence, I would hold that there was no such duty of care as alleged regarding the provision of different or differently equipped vehicles or, a fortiori, regarding the deployment on patrol on 28 February 2006 of the Snatch Land Rovers which were deployed.\n",
              "Moses LJ suggested in the Court of Appeal (para 60) that it was necessary to consider the evidence in order to decide when active operations start and when they finish and that Owen J had recognised that the present cases may not fall within the scope of combat immunity.\n",
              "But, so far as this suggests that Owen J doubted whether active operations were afoot at the dates relevant to either the Smith claim (16 July 2005) or the Ellis claim (28 February 2006), it is wrong.\n",
              "No such argument even appears to have been raised before Owen J or before the Court of Appeal, in relation to either claim.\n",
              "Further, in paras 113 114 of his judgment Owen J expressly struck out the Ellis claim, so far as it relied on the failure to limit the patrol, on the basis that combat immunity did apply as at 28 February 2006.\n",
              "Before the Supreme Court, the nearest there is to any suggestion is the elliptical statement made in para 186 of the Ellis case in the context of combat immunity that Private Ellis was not engaged in a major combat operation that had ended in May 2003.\n",
              "He was part of an armed force providing security and stability to a region of Iraq; at the time of his death he was on a patrol returning from a trip to the Iraqi police headquarters in Al Amarah.\n",
              "It is the Ellis claimants case that this activity should be treated as akin to a peace keeping, police or anti terrorist activity so that the ambit of combat immunity should be very tightly constrained around the actual patrol in question.\n",
              "Even that statement does not challenge the existence of a combat operation involving the patrol, and in any event there is no basis for allowing an entirely new point, contrary to the basis on which the matter was put before the judge, to be raised at this stage.\n",
              "I would therefore also hold that the Ellis claim should be struck out in so far as it is made for common law negligence.\n",
              "Article 2\n",
              "As stated in para 103 above, article 2 is said to involve two substantive obligations: framework and operational.\n",
              "In Stoyanovi v Bulgaria (Application No 42980/04) decided 9 November 2010, the Strasbourg court was concerned with an accidental death in a military training exercise a practice parachute jump during which the deceaseds head hit the aircrafts wheel rendering him unconscious and so unable to open his parachute.\n",
              "The court referred to the operational duty arising, on the authority of Osman v United Kingdom and neryildiz v Turkey, where authorities know or ought to know of a real and immediate risk to life, or of a situation inherently dangerous to life, and to the framework duty in the public health sphere to make regulations compelling hospitals to adopt appropriate measures to protect patients lives and to have an effective independent judicial system to determine the cause of death of patients in hospital and make those responsible accountable.\n",
              "It then went on, at para 61, Positive obligations will vary therefore in their application depending on their context.\n",
              "In the present case, which concerns an accident during a military training exercise, the Court notes that while it may indeed be considered that the armed forces' activities pose a risk to life, this is a situation which differs from those dangerous situations of specific threat to life which arise exceptionally from risks posed by violent, unlawful acts of others or man made or natural hazards.\n",
              "The armed forces, just as doctors in the medical world, routinely engage in activities that potentially could cause harm; it is, in a manner of speaking, part of their essential functioning.\n",
              "Thus, in the present case, parachute training was inherently dangerous but an ordinary part of military duties.\n",
              "Whenever a State undertakes or organises dangerous activities, or authorises them, it must ensure through a system of rules and through sufficient control that the risk is reduced to a reasonable minimum.\n",
              "If nevertheless damage arises, it will only amount to a breach of the State's positive obligations if it was due to insufficient regulations or insufficient control, but not if the damage was caused through the negligent conduct of an individual or the concatenation of unfortunate events (see, for comparison, Kalender v Turkey, Application No 4314/02), 43 47, 15 December 2009).\n",
              "The courts reasoning appears to have been that, in so far as military life is inherently dangerous, there could be no question of any operational duty to prevent that danger.\n",
              "This seems fairly self evident, and is certainly consistent with the Strasbourg courts recognition in other cases of the need to bear in mind the particular characteristics of military life and its effects on the situation of individual members of the armed forces (Engel v The Netherlands (No 1) (1976) 1 EHRR 647, para 54), meaning, for example, also that many acts that would constitute degrading or inhuman treatment in respect of prisoners may not reach the threshold of ill treatment when they occur in the armed forces, provided that they contribute to the specific mission of the armed forces in that they form part of, for example, training for battlefield conditions (Chember v Russia, (Application No 7188/03) (unreported) given 3 July 2008, para 49).\n",
              "However, as the court stated in Stoyanovi, the state must by the same token have a system of rules and sufficient control to reduce the risks to a reasonable minimum.\n",
              "In Kalender v Tutrkey (Application No 4314/02) (unreported) given 15 December 2009, cited by the court, liability under the substantive aspect of article 2, was held to exist in the light of numerous failings in the structure and operation of a railway station, leading to passengers having, without supervision or warning, to disembark and cross a line used by other trains and being killed in the process.\n",
              "Accordingly, it appears that the framework duty may in appropriate circumstances operate at a low level.\n",
              "In domestic contexts where the state is taking armed action affecting or liable to affect third persons, the court has undertaken quite close and in the upshot critical examination of the states conduct.\n",
              "I cited examples in para 196 of my judgment in Catherine Smith: Such cases start with McCann v United Kingdom (1995) I EHRR 97, relating to the shooting by SAS officers of members of the Provisional IRA suspected of planning to attack the Royal Anglian Regiment in Gibraltar, and include Isayeva, Yusupova and Bazayeva v Russia (Applications Nos 57947/00, 57948/00 and 57949/00), 24 February 2005, and Isayeva v Russia (Application No 57950/00), 24 February 2005, relating to the conduct of military operations by the Russian armed forces against Chechen separatist fighters which led to the deaths of civilians.\n",
              "In such cases, it appears that the exigencies of military life go to the standard and performance, rather than the existence of, any Convention duty.\n",
              "The question is whether the Strasbourg court would take a similar attitude to the responsibility of a state for the death of a member of its own armed forces in circumstances alleged to have involved mistaken decisions in the course of an operation or act of war (such as alleged by Mrs Smith in at least paragraphs 26.2 to 26.5 of her claim), or failings in planning or in the equipping or training of such forces (such as alleged by Mrs Smith in paras 26.1 and it seems paras 26.6 and 26.7 of her claim and by the Ellis claimants in probably all three particulars in their para 26).\n",
              "In this connection it is relevant to bear in mind that the Strasbourg court has curtailed the operational duty, so that it does not embrace mere casual acts of negligence, certainly in the field of health care and, as appears logical, in other fields: see my judgment in Catherine Smith, para 201 and the cases there cited, to which can now be added Stoyanovi v Bulgaria (Application No 42980/04), para 61, where the European Court of Human Rights said that a death occurring during an inherently dangerous training activity (parachute jumping) undertaken by a soldier would not involve any breach of article 2 if caused through the negligent conduct of an individual (see para 138 above).\n",
              "Mr Weir QC regretted this qualification as deeply unsatisfactory, and as a manifestation of the fact that (in his words) the search for principle has been called off in this area.\n",
              "An alternative view might be that it would have been better if the Strasbourg court had left the development and application of the law of tort to domestic legal systems, subject to clearly defined criteria, rather than set about creating what amounts in many respects to an independent substantive law of tort, overlapping with domestic tort law, but limited to cases involving death or the risk of death.\n",
              "Be that as it may be, the exception for casual acts of negligence is relevant to show that liability under article 2 can be tailored and limited in what the Strasbourg court regards as appropriate circumstances.\n",
              "In the present circumstances, the question arises whether that the Strasbourg court would regard article 2 in its substantive aspect as making the state liable for the death in combat of one soldier due to alleged negligence of his commander or of another soldier.\n",
              "The prospect of the Strasbourg court reviewing the conduct of combat operations in this way seems to me sufficiently striking, for it to be impossible to give this question a positive answer.\n",
              "If the European Court considers that the Convention requires it to undertake the retrospective review of armed conflicts to adjudicate upon the relations between a state and its own soldiers, without recognising any principle similar to combat immunity, then it seems to me that a domestic court should await clear guidance from Strasbourg to that effect.\n",
              "That leaves for consideration whether the framework duty involves an obligation on the part of the state to exercise due care in the course of planning armed operations, and in equipping and training its armed forces, so as to reduce or limit the risks to life involved in such operations.\n",
              "In my opinion it is not possible to conclude that the Strasbourg court would hold that such matters are justiciable under the Convention, any more than they are at common law.\n",
              "I am not over enamoured of the cautionary warning to this court that the road to Strasbourg is a one way street, which a claimant can tread if this Court has not gone far enough, but which the state cannot tread if this Court goes too far.\n",
              "If it is clear from prior authority or this Court is otherwise confident about what Strasbourg will decide, then we should decide the issue as we believe correct.\n",
              "But in the present very difficult case, two connected considerations lead me to consider that caution is called for.\n",
              "First, having decided that the common law recognises no such duty or care or claims as the claimants advance, we should not lightly conclude, in so important and sensitive an area of national life, that the Strasbourg court would take a different view.\n",
              "Second, since I have no confidence about the scope or application of any positive duties which the Strasbourg court might recognise under article 2 in the area, I believe it would be wrong for this Court to advance way ahead of anything that it has yet decided.\n",
              "It should be for the Strasbourg court to decide whether it will review the procurement and training policy of the British army over recent decades in the context of claims under article 2 for compensation arising from deaths of serving soldiers during active military operations.\n",
              "Support for the view that the Strasbourg court does recognise areas of policy into which the Convention protection does not stretch is afforded by two cases.\n",
              "First, in Taylor v United Kingdom (Application No 23412/94) (unreported) 30 August 1994, the Commission held that article 2 did not require the investigation into the killing by Beverley Allitt, a hospital nurse, of child patients to enquire into the responsibility in the NHS for alleged inadequate systems, resource shortages and weak leadership.\n",
              "In holding the application manifestly ill founded and inadmissible, it stated: The Commission acknowledges that neither the criminal proceedings nor the Inquiry addressed the wider issues relating to the organisation and funding of the National Health Service as a whole or the pressures which might have led to a ward being run subject to the shortcomings apparent on Ward Four.\n",
              "The procedural element contained in article 2 of the Convention however imposes the minimum requirement that where a state or its agents potentially bear responsibility for loss of life, the events in question should be subject to an effective investigation or scrutiny which enables the facts to become known to the public, and in particular to the relatives of any victims.\n",
              "The Commission finds no indication that the facts of this case have not been sufficiently investigated and disclosed, or that there has been any failure to provide a mechanism whereby those with criminal or civil responsibility may be held answerable.\n",
              "The wider questions raised by the case are within the public domain and any doubts which may consequently arise as to policies adopted in the field of public health are, in the Commissions opinion, matters for public and political debate which fall outside the scope of article 2 and the other provisions of the Convention.\n",
              "The second case concerned article 3 of the Convention.\n",
              "In Banks v United Kingdom (2007) 45 EHRR SE2, the ECtHR rejected a claim that article 3 required a public inquiry into allegations of torture and inhuman treatment of prisoners at a UK prison.\n",
              "The Court held that the facts had been sufficiently investigated and that: The wider questions raised by the case as to the background of assaults and the remedial measures apt to prevent any recurrence in a prison in the future are, in the Courts opinion, matters for public and political debate which fall outside the scope of article 3 of the Convention.\n",
              "In my opinion therefore this Court should proceed on the basis that the policy considerations which guide its domestic law in the present area of national interest will find an echo in Strasbourg, and not invade a field which would involve, in the context of claims for civil compensation, extensive and highly sensitive review with the benefit of hindsight the United Kingdoms countrys policies, strategy and tactics relating to the deployment and use of its armed forces in combat.\n",
              "The United Kingdoms performance of its investigatory and procedural duties under article 2 is not in doubt, as attested by the sadly numerous inquests (investigating and recording the circumstances of each death) and the still incomplete Chilcot Enquiry (delayed inter alia it is understood by problems relating to the release or use of documents with national security implications).\n",
              "The issue with which this judgment is concerned is whether deaths and (at common law) injuries in combat fall to be investigated in the civil courts, at whatever level in the armed forces, Whitehall or the government responsibility for them is suggested to arise.\n",
              "The answer I would give is, no.\n",
              "The majority approach\n",
              "I agree with Lord Hope (para 100) about the paramount importance that the work that the armed services do in the national interest should not be impeded by having to prepare for or conduct active operations against the enemy under the threat of litigation if things should go wrong.\n",
              "But I do not consider that the majority approach reflects or meets this imperative.\n",
              "In summary, I understand that this approach: (a) recognises at common law a principle of combat immunity, as excluding liability for negligence in respect of any act or omission on the part of those who are actually engaged in active combat (paragraph 82), since no one can imagine a court undertaking the trial of an issue as to whether a soldier on the field of battle or a sailor on his ship might reasonably be more careful to avoid causing civil loss or damage (para 94); (b) recognises allegations as beyond the reach of article 2 . if they relate to things done or not done when those who might be thought to be responsible for avoiding the risk of death or injury to others were actively engaged in direct contact with the enemy (para 76), and extends this to operational decisions made on the ground by commanders, whatever their rank or level of seniority (para 64); but also; (c) suggests that liability (under the Osman v United Kingdom principle, (1998) 29 EHRR 245, para 115) for failure to take preventative operational measures in the face of a real, direct and immediate threat to life could extend to procurement decisions taken on the ground about the provision of vehicles or equipment, as well as to decisions taken about their deployment (para 78); (d) recognises that the more political (in a broad or narrow sense) a decision, the slower a court should be to impose liability at common law and/or under article 2 (para 65), so that it will easy to find that allegations are beyond the reach of article 2 and do not give rise to liability in common law negligence if they concern decisions that were or ought to have been taken about training, procurement or the conduct of operations . at a high level of command and closely linked to the exercise of political judgment and issues of policy (paras 76 and 99).\n",
              "It is unclear to me whether on this approach liability is said to be beyond the reach of article 2 because of its nature or simply because of an injunction that courts should be very slow to find fault in the areas concerned.\n",
              "Whatever the position in that respect, I see real difficulties in the undefined boundaries and the suggested middle ground between on the one hand (a) and (b) and on the other (d).\n",
              "The suggestion in para 78 that Osman type liability could exist as mentioned in point (c) would also appear liable to extend fault based liability to all aspects of decision making during combat operations.\n",
              "What is the logical distinction between deployment of equipment and of troops? The inter twining of issues of procurement and training with issues relating to the causation of injury or death on the battlefield seems highly likely to lead to a court undertaking the trial of unimaginable issues as to whether a soldier on the field of battle or a sailor on his ship might reasonably have been more careful.\n",
              "Further, I see little attraction in a scheme according to which the acts or omissions of the man on the ground and the policy maker in Whitehall give rise either to no liability at all or only to liability in egregious cases, but the procurement, training and deployment decisions of a middle rank commander (query, in Whitehall or in local headquarters or both) are subject to scrutiny under conventional principles of fault based liability.\n",
              "All depends, as I understand it, under article 2 upon balancing private and public interests and Convention rights (para 61); or upon balancing (i) the need to avoid undermining the ability of a state to defend itself, or its interests, at home or abroad (para 66) and the paramount importance of not impeding the armed forces against (ii) the consideration that (at common law) soldiers injured or (at common law and under the Convention) the relatives and dependants of soldiers killed should be able, wherever possible, to benefit by the more substantial civil measure of recovery that fault based liability brings, over and above the no fault compensation available in cases of injury or death as described by Lord Carnwath in para 181 of his judgment.\n",
              "Still more fundamentally, the approach taken by the majority will in my view make extensive litigation almost inevitable after, as well as quite possibly during and even before, any active service operations undertaken by the British army.\n",
              "It is likely to lead to the judicialisation of war, in sharp contrast with Starke Js dictum in Shaw Savill (1940) 66 CLR 344 that war cannot be controlled or conducted by judicial tribunals.\n",
              "No doubt it would be highly desirable if all disputes with international legal implications were to be submitted to international judicial resolution, with those involved abiding by the outcome; and if wars were no more.\n",
              "But, in the present imperfect world, there is no precedent for claims to impose civil liability for damages on states whose armed forces are killed or injured in armed combat as a result of alleged failures of decision making either in the course of, or in procuring equipment or providing training for, such combat.\n",
              "All the claims made in these appeals fall in my view within one or other of these areas where the common law should not tread.\n",
              "Similarly, we should not assume that the European Court of Human Rights would regard it as appropriate to enter such areas under article 2, and there is to my mind wholly insufficient guidance to lead to any conclusion that it would.\n",
              "We cannot, at least at present, refer a case to Strasbourg to seek its guidance on the proper interpretation of article 2.\n",
              "But my conclusions as to the common law position and its rationale, the dearth of any authority for any like claim in the Strasbourg jurisprudence and statements in that jurisprudence showing that policy decisions can be non justiciable all lead me to conclude that we should for the present proceed on the basis that the outcome in Strasbourg would in the present areas be no different from the outcome at common law.\n",
              "Conclusion\n",
              "The upshot is that, in my opinion, although the soldiers involved in these cases were within the United Kingdoms jurisdiction for the purposes of article 2 of the Convention of Human Rights at the material times, the claims made under article 2 and/or in negligence in respect of their deaths were, in the case of the Smith and Ellis claims, rightly struck out by the courts below and the Ministry of Defences appeal seeking to strike out the Challenger claims should be allowed.\n",
              "LORD CARNWATH\n",
              "Introduction\n",
              "I agree entirely with Lord Hopes treatment of the jurisdiction issue.\n",
              "There is also much with which I agree in his discussion of the substantive issues, in particular his comment (para 100) on the paramount importance that the preparation for and conduct of active operations should not take place under the threat of litigation if things should go wrong.\n",
              "However, in agreement with Lord Mance, I do not think it is an adequate response at this level for us simply to send the claims for trial with general injunctions to exercise great caution or special care.\n",
              "Having heard full argument on all these issues, we should be able to rule whether the claims are in principle viable or not; or at least to give clearer guidance as to what answers to what questions of fact may or may not lead to a favourable result following trial.\n",
              "I also agree with Lord Mance that, contrary to the approach adopted by Lord Hope, we should first concentrate on the common law aspects of the claims.\n",
              "In this respect, the balance of the relevant issues may have been distorted by the sequence of submissions at the hearing.\n",
              "It is understandable, given the importance of the jurisdictional issues arising under the Convention, that much of the oral hearing time was taken up with submissions on that subject, and as a natural extension with arguments about the substantive scope of article 2 itself.\n",
              "On the latter aspect, I have nothing to add to Lord Mances reasoning and conclusions, with which I agree.\n",
              "However, like him, I consider that our primary responsibility should be for the coherent and principled development of the common law, which is within our own control.\n",
              "We cannot determine the limits of article 2.\n",
              "Indeed, the multiplicity of views expressed by the nine members of this court, when this issue was previously considered in Catherine Smith, shows how difficult and unproductive it can be, even at this level, to attempt to predict how Strasbourg will ultimately draw the lines.\n",
              "The trial judge will be in no stronger position.\n",
              "With respect to Lord Hope (para 79), if the problem is a lack of directly relevant guidance from Strasbourg, it is hard to see how, simply by hearing further evidence or finding further facts, he or she will be better able to fill that gap, still less to do so with complete confidence.\n",
              "Common law the nature of the issues\n",
              "It is important to recognise that we are being asked to authorise an extension of the law of negligence (as indeed of article 2), into a new field.\n",
              "We have not been referred to any authority in the higher courts, in this country or any comparable jurisdiction, in which the state has been held liable for injuries sustained by its own soldiers in the course of active hostilities.\n",
              "Further we are concerned only with duties at common law, rather than under statute.\n",
              "As the Court of Appeal recognised [2013] 2 WLR 27 (para 38), statutory regulations governing the responsibilities of the Ministry as employers do not apply outside the United Kingdom.\n",
              "Mr Eadies case, on behalf of the Ministry, was advanced on a broad front.\n",
              "As formulated in his printed case, this involved a root and branch objection to any form of civil liability in this area.\n",
              "It was introduced by a lengthy section headed: The difficulties courts would face grappling with the issues raised in these claims (paras 72 92).\n",
              "Not only were the courts institutionally incompetent to resolve such issues which are essentially matters of political and military judgement; but there are strong reasons both of public policy and democratic accountability for them not seeking to do so.\n",
              "There is some common ground.\n",
              "There is no dispute as to the existence in domestic law of a principle known as combat immunity, relating to decisions and actions in the heat of battle.\n",
              "Furthermore, at the other end of the spectrum Lord Hope accepts, as I understand it, that high level decisions about procurement or conduct of operations are not open to review in the courts.\n",
              "This dichotomy is most clearly stated in his para 76: It will be easy to find that allegations are beyond the reach of article 2 if the decisions that were or ought to have been taken about training, procurement or the conduct of operations were at a high level of command and closely linked to the exercise of political judgment and issues of policy.\n",
              "So too if they relate to things done or not done when those who might be thought to be responsible for avoiding the risk of death or injury to others were actively engaged in direct contact with the enemy.\n",
              "Although this comes as part of his consideration of article 2, he treats it as equally relevant to the common law claims (para 99).\n",
              "On that view, the difference between us is over the extent (if any) of what he calls the middle ground, and whether its boundaries can only be determined after the finding of further facts.\n",
              "Here too the balance of the discussion may have been distorted by the course of the submissions at the hearing.\n",
              "The emphasis of the common law debate was directed mainly to the scope of the combat immunity defence as such, rather than issues arising under the general law of negligence.\n",
              "No doubt reflecting that emphasis, the wider issues are dealt with relatively shortly at the end of Lord Hopes judgment.\n",
              "In my view, however, it is within that broader compass that the solution to these difficult questions must be found if not at this preliminary stage, then following the trial.\n",
              "In truth, the claimants are caught on the horns of a dilemma.\n",
              "The operational phases of the undertaking, which might otherwise under ordinary principles have been expected to give rise to a duty of care (see eg Wade and Forsyth Administrative Law, 10th ed (2009), p 653ff; Craig Administrative Law, 7th ed (2012), p 908ff) are, as the claimants accept, the very phases which are excluded from review by the combat immunity defence.\n",
              "On the other hand the further back in time they seek to direct their challenge so as to include issues of planning, procurement, and training, the more they have to confront the competing principle that discretionary decisions about policy and resources are not justiciable.\n",
              "The issue is whether it is possible to carve out some middle ground of potential liability.\n",
              "The answer to that question raises issues of principle, policy and practicality.\n",
              "Mr Weir QC rightly emphasises that the importance of another policy consideration, the principle that where there is a wrong there should be a remedy, described by Lord Dyson JSC as a cornerstone of our system of justice (Jones v Kaney [2011] UKSC 13; [2011] 2 AC 398, para 113).\n",
              "From that principle he draws the submission that: The default position is one whereby the MoD owes its soldiers an orthodox employers duty of care.\n",
              "So it falls for the MoD to establish that public policy must operate to deny the existence of that recognised duty of care.\n",
              "However, that formulation begs a logically prior question.\n",
              "I agree that it is for the Ministry to make the case for any policy exception to any recognised duty of care.\n",
              "But the scope and content of any such duty of care are themselves matters for determination.\n",
              "In the modern law of negligence, the starting point for determining that issue is the application of the familiar three fold test laid down in Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605, 618 per Lord Bridge.\n",
              "In that context, the scope of any so called immunity necessarily overlaps with the question, under the third part of that test, whether it is fair, just and reasonable for the law to impose a duty of care at all (see Clerk & Lindsell On Torts 20th ed (2010), para 14 39ff Immunities).\n",
              "As Lord Browne Wilkinson has said: a holding that it is not fair, just and reasonable to hold liable a particular class of defendants whether generally or in relation to a particular type of activity is not to give immunity from a liability to which the rest of the world is subject.\n",
              "It is a prerequisite to there being any liability in negligence at all that as a matter of policy it is fair, just and reasonable in those circumstances to impose liability in negligence. (Barrett v Enfield London Borough Council [2001] 2 AC 550, 559)\n",
              "For that reason I agree with Lord Mance that the scope of combat immunity should now be discussed, not as a separate principle, but as part of the third element of the Caparo analysis.\n",
              "Equally, in my view, we should not see ourselves as necessarily constrained by the limits illustrated by the existing case law on combat immunity, developed in very different circumstances and (until Mulcahy) without reference to the modern law of negligence.\n",
              "Working by analogy\n",
              "In determining whether a duty of care should be imposed in a new factual situation, precedent is an important guide.\n",
              "In Caparo Lord Bridge proposed that the emphasis should be less on the search for underlying general principles, but rather on the development of the law incrementally and by analogy with established categories (ibid p 618, quoting Brennan J. in the High Court of Australia, Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman (1985) 60 ALR 1, 43 44).\n",
              "In the present context, apart from the cases on combat immunity as such (discussed by Lord Hope and Lord Mance) the closest analogies in my view are to be found in two lines of authority: first, the sequence of authorities relating to the immunity of the police, culminating in Van Colle v Chief Constable of the Hertfordshire Police (Secretary of State of the Home Department intervening) [2009] AC 225; secondly, in respect of the issue of breach, assuming an actionable duty of care is established, the cases relating to the law of negligence as applied to the emergency services, in particular to claims by employees.\n",
              "Police immunity\n",
              "On the issue whether a duty of care should be imposed, the most useful parallel in the modern law, in my view, is to be found in the sequence of authorities dealing with the possible liability of the police for alleged negligence in the course of investigating crime.\n",
              "In Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [1989] AC 53 it was held that for reasons of public policy the police owed no actionable duty of care to a victim in such circumstances.\n",
              "They were said to be immune from actions of this kind (p 64, per Lord Keith).\n",
              "Initial concerns that this approach might conflict with article 6 of the Convention by precluding consideration of the merits of the claim (see Osman v United Kingdom (1998) 29 EHRR 245) were dispelled by the Strasbourg court in Z v United Kingdom (2001) 34 EHRR 97.\n",
              "The Grand Chamber, following the lead of Lord Browne Wilkinson (X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council [1995] 2 AC 633,751) accepted the legitimate role of policy in determining the limits of liability: the Court is not persuaded that the House of Lords' decision that as a matter of law there was no duty of care in the applicants' case may be characterised as either an exclusionary rule or an immunity which deprived them of access to court the House of Lords was concerned with the issue whether a novel category of negligence, that is a category of case in which a duty of care had not previously been held to exist, should be developed by the courts in their law making role under the common law.\n",
              "The House of Lords, after weighing in the balance the competing considerations of public policy, decided not to extend liability in negligence into a new area.\n",
              "In so doing, it circumscribed the range of liability under tort law. (para 96, emphasis added) Echoing that approach, in Brooks v Comr of Police of the Metropolis [2005] UKHL 24; [2005] 1 WLR 1495, the House confirmed but qualified the core principle established in Hill.\n",
              "In his leading speech Lord Steyn said: since the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Z v United Kingdom (2001) 34 EHRR 97, 138, para 100, it would be best for the principle in Hills case to be reformulated in terms of the absence of a duty of care rather than a blanket immunity. (para 27)\n",
              "Finally, in Van Colle v Chief Constable of the Hertfordshire Police [2009] AC 225, the House by a majority held that the same principle applied even where the police were aware of a specific threat to an individual witness.\n",
              "That is particularly helpful in the present context because it was concerned with the scope of the states liability both at common law and under article 2 of the Convention.\n",
              "I draw the following points from the judgments: The common law claim was to be considered on its own merits i) (stand on its own feet) rather than assimilated with the article 2 claim (para 82, per Lord Hope; para 136, Lord Brown). ii) The common law analysis began from the three fold test laid down in Caparo by which it must be shown that harm to B was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of what A did or failed to do, that the relationship of A and B was one of sufficient proximity, and that in all the circumstances it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on A towards B. (para 42, per Lord Bingham). iii) The majority were able to support an exception based on public policy reasons which were accommodated within the third element of that test, that being accepted as a price to be paid by individuals denied for public policy reasons (as not being fair, just and reasonable within the Caparo principle) a civil claim in the interests of the community as a whole (para 139, per Lord Brown) iv) There was no suggestion that, because the core principle involved an exception to ordinary principles of liability, it should be narrowly construed.\n",
              "On the contrary, as Lord Brown put it, the wider public interest is best served by maintaining the full width of the Hill principle (para 139). v) The House was able to determine the limits of this principle on the basis of the pleadings.\n",
              "Again I quote Lord Brown (para 140): In common, I think, with all your Lordships, I regards this issue as plainly one which the House should decide one way or the other on the pleaded facts.\n",
              "Either a duty of care arises on these facts or it does not.\n",
              "No useful purpose would be served by allowing the action to go to trial for facts to be found and then for further consideration to be given to the applicable law. vi) Finally, the policy considerations justifying immunity in respect of the polices function of investigating crime were contrasted with civil operational tasks, in relation to which liability had been accepted in some decided cases (Lord Hope, para 79).\n",
              "Those examples were not regarded as undermining the core principle.\n",
              "This line of cases shows that it remains a proper function of the court, faced with a potential clash between public and private interests, to determine as a matter of policy the limits of any actionable duty of care, and to do so at the preliminary stage (see also Jonathan Morgan, Negligence into Battle [2013] CLJ 14, commenting on the Court of Appeals reasoning in the present case).\n",
              "Furthermore, so to determine the limits of liability in negligence in a new area, by balancing competing considerations of public policy, is within the margin allowed to the national courts by Convention law.\n",
              "Lord Hope acknowledges this line of authority, but declines to apply the same approach to the present context (paras 97 98).\n",
              "With respect, I find this difficult to understand.\n",
              "If this was an appropriate exercise in relation to the purely domestic policy concerns arising from police powers of investigation, how much more so in relation to the issues of vital national security raised by the preparation for and conduct of war?\n",
              "Negligence and the emergency services\n",
              "Assuming a duty of care is not excluded under the principles considered so far, the closest analogies are to be found in cases relating to the duties owed by employees to their staff in the context of the delivery of emergency services.\n",
              "King v Sussex Ambulance Service NHS Trust [2002] ICR 1413 contains an authoritative exposition of the relevant principles.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal dismissed a claim related to injuries sustained by an ambulance technician, who was required in the course of an emergency call to help in carrying a patient downstairs.\n",
              "Hale LJ, giving the majority judgment, summarised the relevant law (paras 21 23): The starting point is that an ambulance service owes the same duty of care towards its employees as does any other employer.\n",
              "There is no special rule in English law qualifying the obligations of others towards fire fighters, or presumably police officers, ambulance technicians and others whose occupations in the public service are inherently dangerous: see Ogwu v Taylor [1988] 1 AC 431.\n",
              "Such public servants accept the risks which are inherent in their work, but not the risks which the exercise of reasonable care on the part of those who owe them a duty of care could avoid.\n",
              "An employer owes his employees a duty to take reasonable care to provide safe equipment and a safe system of work, which includes assessing the tasks to be undertaken, training in how to perform those tasks as safely as possible, and supervision in performing them.\n",
              "This was subject to two qualifications: first, the further dimension identified by Denning LJ (Watt v Hertfordshire County Council [1954] 1 WLR 835, 838): It is well settled that in measuring due care you must balance the risk against the measures necessary to eliminate the risk.\n",
              "To that proposition there ought to be added this: you must balance the risk against the end to be achieved. and secondly (citing Colman J in Walker v Northumberland County Council [1995] ICR 702, 712): what is reasonable may have to be judged in the light of the service's duties to the public and the resources available to it to\n",
              "perform those duties\n",
              "In Hughes v National Union of Mineworkers ([1991] 4 All ER 278, cited by Lord Hope, para 97), this approach was taken a stage further so as to deny the existence of a duty of care at all.\n",
              "The claim was by a police officer who had been injured when, in the course of policing a strike at a colliery, he was knocked to the ground by an advancing crowd of pickets.\n",
              "He alleged negligence by the police officers on the day, rather than wider issues relating to police deployment generally or training (p 281a).\n",
              "The claim was rejected.\n",
              "It was held by May J, applying Caparo principles, and following Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire that public policy requires that senior police officers should not generally be liable to their subordinates who may be injured by rioters or the like for on the spot operational decisions taken in the course of attempts to control serious public disorder.\n",
              "That, in my judgment, should be the general rule in cases of policing serious public disorders. (p 288d e).\n",
              "In Multiple Claimants (at para 2.C.17) Owen J treated Hughes as example of the application of the combat immunity defence, noting that it had been cited in that context by the Court of Appeal in Mulcahy v Ministry of Defence [1996] QB 732, ((at pp 747, 751).\n",
              "He was considering the question: Does the immunity apply to anti terrorist, policing and peace keeping operations of the kind in which British forces were engaged in Northern Ireland and in Bosnia? (para 2.C.17) He gave a qualified yes, concluding that the immunity would apply to peace keeping/policing operations in which service personnel are exposed to the attack or threat of attack (para 2.C.20).\n",
              "This interpretation seems open to question.\n",
              "However violent was the situation facing the police during the mineworkers strike, there could be no argument that it had anything to do with the conduct of war, nor was the judges reasoning linked to that group of cases.\n",
              "While I would not wish to question the actual decision in Hughes, it is in my view better seen as an application of King principles in an extreme situation.\n",
              "The decisions in both King and Hughes were concerned with the operations, rather than with prior policy decisions about the nature of the service and the resources to be committed to them, or issues such as procurement and training.\n",
              "To illustrate the possible limits of operational liability in relation to the emergency services, a useful analogy can be found in Rigby v Chief Constable of Northamptonshire [1985] 1 WLR 1242.\n",
              "The police were held liable by Taylor J for damage caused by firing a gas canister into the plaintiffs premises without having fire fighting equipment available.\n",
              "On the other hand (relying on Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office [1970] AC 1004, and cases following it) the judge rejected a claim based on the failure of the Chief Constable to equip the force with an alternative CS gas device, known as Ferret, which did not carry the same fire risk.\n",
              "In that respect he accepted the submission that the constable was exercising a statutory discretion which could not be impugned if exercised bona fide (pp 1250 1251).\n",
              "That decision, which is cited by Wade (op cit p 656) as an illustration of the policy operational decision, has not as far as I aware been questioned in later authority.\n",
              "Statutory intervention\n",
              "Before drawing some conclusions, and for completeness, although it did not figure prominently in the oral argument, I should address the suggestion that the claim gains at least implicit support from the Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987.\n",
              "In short, it is said, there is no policy reason to extend the scope of immunity beyond acts or omissions occurring in the heat of battle, given that Parliament has now provided a new statutory framework covering both general liability and the means to secure greater protection where exceptionally it is required.\n",
              "It was the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 which opened the way generally to proceedings in tort against the Crown.\n",
              "However, section 10 preserved a specific and precisely defined statutory exception for the armed forces in relation to injury or death on service subject to the conditions outlined in the section, one being a certificate of entitlement to a service pension (see Clerk & Lindsell op cit para 5 08ff).\n",
              "That exclusion was repealed by the 1987 Act, but (by section 2) subject to a power for the Secretary of State to make an order reviving the effect of section 10 in certain circumstances.\n",
              "By section 2(2): The Secretary of State shall not make an order reviving the effect of the said section 10 for any purposes unless it appears to him necessary or expedient to do so (a) by reason of any imminent national danger or of any great emergency that has arisen; or (b) for the purposes of any warlike operations in any part of the world outside the United Kingdom or of any other operations which are or are to be carried out in connection with the warlike activity of any persons in any such part of the world.\n",
              "Although we were not referred by the parties to any background materials relating to that change, the Parliamentary history is of some interest.\n",
              "A written answer by the Secretary of State for Defence explains that it followed a review of the working of section 10 (Hansard HC Deb 08 December 1986 vol 107 cc85 86W).\n",
              "He said: Section 10 was included in the 1947 Act on the grounds that members of the Armed Forces, by the very nature of their profession, undertake hazardous tasks which ordinary members of the public do not.\n",
              "At that time it was believed that this provision would not result in any overall financial penalty against servicemen, because they received benefits, payable regardless of fault, which were in most cases comparable with those which a civilian might expect from the courts.\n",
              "Our review has, however, shown that damages which courts have awarded in some cases of personal injury have now risen to a level which can considerably exceed the benefits which the serviceman receives.\n",
              "The Government have concluded that repeal of section 10 is the only satisfactory course which will remove this disadvantage We shall need to be able to reactivate the provisions of section 10 in the event of impending or actual hostilities or grave national emergency.\n",
              "It was indicated that, while the government did not have time to promote its own legislation within the current programme, it would be ready to support a suitable Bill brought by a private Member.\n",
              "This invitation was taken up by Mr Winston Churchill MP (HC Deb 13 February 1987 vol 110 cc567 609).\n",
              "The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, welcoming the Bill on the part of the government commented: The Bill seeks to retain the power to reactivate section 10 at a time of great national emergency or in the event of actual or impending hostilities.\n",
              "That is widely accepted by the House.\n",
              "Indeed, I have not heard any hon.\n",
              "Member advocate in the debate that section 10 should not be reimposed in time of war.\n",
              "It is not possible or desirable to draw hard and fast definitions of the circumstances in which the Government might seek to reimpose section 10, but the wording of clause 2 is satisfactory in this respect, making it clear from that the Secretary of State will need to consider it necessary or expedient to make an order to reactivate section 10 by reason of a great national emergency or imminent national danger or in the event of warlike operations or connected activities outside the United Kingdom.\n",
              "We are talking about a grave situation in Britain or elsewhere, and I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the wording of clause 2 to a large extent mirrors the wording of the provisions of the Reserve Forces Act 1980 dealing with the call up of reserves.\n",
              "Although there is no intention to create a formal link between, say, mobilisation and the reimposition of section 10, hon Members will recognise that that gives an indication of the gravity of the circumstances in which reimposition of section 10 would arise.\n",
              "Those passages raise a number of possible issues, on which we have heard no argument, as to either relevance or substance.\n",
              "One indeed might be the scope of phrase warlike activities (cf Reserve Forces Act 1996, s 54) in its possible application to peace keeping operations such as are in issue in the Snatch claims.\n",
              "We cannot resolve those questions within the scope of the arguments we have heard, and it is unnecessary to do so.\n",
              "It should be noted in any event that the provisions for no fault compensation have changed materially since 1987 when that debate took place.\n",
              "The governing legislation is now the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Act 2004, with the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme made under it.\n",
              "Awards are based on a detailed tariff, which is kept under review, and there is provision for appeal to a specialised tribunal.\n",
              "The scheme was most recently revised in 2011, following a review by Lord Boyce.\n",
              "However, it was not part of Mr Eadies case that the existence of that scheme, or its overlap with the law of negligence, should affect our consideration of the issues before us.\n",
              "In my view these two sets of statutory provisions are no more than neutral, and neither assists in establishing the limits of the duty of care in the present context.\n",
              "It is not argued for the claimants that the 1987 Act impinges in any way on the defence of combat immunity as hitherto understood.\n",
              "At most it is said to be relevant in determining what is fair, just and reasonable under Caparo principles.\n",
              "However, there is nothing in the 1987 Act to suggest that it was intended to inhibit the ordinary, and logically prior, function of the court in determining the limits of potential liability under the law of negligence.\n",
              "It is only in so far as liability is so established that the scope of immunity under the Act becomes relevant.\n",
              "Finally, under this section, it is of interest to note how similar issues have been dealt with in the USA, although again we have not heard any submissions on this aspect.\n",
              "Until 1946 claims against the Federal Government without its consent were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\n",
              "This position was altered by the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C.A 1346(b), which can be seen as the equivalent of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 in the United Kingdom.\n",
              "The FTCA abrogated sovereign immunity in relation to the Federal Government in most circumstances.\n",
              "However, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. 2680(j), the sovereign immunity of the Federal Government is not abrogated in respect of [a]ny claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war.\n",
              "A further exception relating to injuries incident to service has been developed judicially, known as the Feres doctrine (Feres v United States, 340 U.S. 135 (S.Ct. 1950)).\n",
              "According to a leading textbook (Speiser, Krause and Gans The American Law of Torts (2010) para 17:5): The critical and lasting rationale of the Feres doctrine is the third one the military disciplinary structure.\n",
              "The lawsuit cannot require a civilian court to second guess military decisions [see Stencel Aero Engineering Corp v United States, 431 U.S. 666, 673 (1977)], and the suit cannot conceivably impair essential military discipline [see Chappell v Wallace, 462 U.S. 296, 300, 302, 304 (1983) (such complex, subtle and professional decisions as the composition, training . and control of a military force are essentially professional military judgments].\n",
              "Despite certain confusion in the broad statements of the courts, and notwithstanding critical comments, the Feres doctrine of denial of recovery has displayed a charmed life and continuing vitality.\n",
              "The cases show that in practice the Feres doctrine has been applied so as to give immunity in a wide range of situations, not directly linked to armed conflict.\n",
              "Conclusions\n",
              "I have discussed these issues at some length, albeit in a minority judgment, because in my view they deserve greater attention than they have been given in the oral argument or the majority judgment.\n",
              "They remain matters which will need to be considered when the case goes to trial.\n",
              "In this respect I do not regard my analysis as conflicting significantly with the majoritys approach.\n",
              "The main difference is that I would have preferred to reach decisions at this stage.\n",
              "In agreement with Lord Mance, and for the same reasons, I would have struck out the Challenger claims.\n",
              "As I have said, in considering the scope of any actionable duty of care relating to the preparation for or conduct of war activities in the modern law of negligence, I do not think we should regard ourselves as constrained by the limits of combat immunity as established in the earlier cases.\n",
              "The proper application of Caparo principles, as illustrated by the sequence of authorities on police liability, enables us to extend and adapt those limits within the scope of the modern law of negligence, and to hold that there is no middle ground of potential liability in relation to the preparation for, or conduct of, war.\n",
              "As I understand Lord Hopes judgment, it leaves the trial judge free, albeit after further factual inquiry, to reach the same conclusion.\n",
              "In my view, differing from Lord Mance in this respect only, we should apply different considerations to the later Snatch claims.\n",
              "They occurred in July 2005 and February 2006, after the time (May 2003) when (as Lord Hope explains: para 1) major combat operations ceased and were replaced by a period of military occupation.\n",
              "Now that the cases are to go to trial, I would not regard consideration of this issue as necessarily constrained by the shape of the arguments in the lower courts or before us.\n",
              "It is not surprising that Owen J drew no such distinction since, as I have noted, he had already held in Multiple Claimants that such operations were in principle within the scope of the combat immunity defence.\n",
              "The Court of Appeal did not address this issue in detail, but as I understand their judgment left it as raising questions of fact to be decided at trial.\n",
              "If as I believe the policy reasons for excluding liability are related to the special features of war or active hostilities, it would be wrong in my view to apply the same approach to peace keeping operations, however intrinsically dangerous.\n",
              "The ordinary principles of negligence, as illustrated by cases such as Hughes and Rigby, can when necessary be sufficiently restrictive to ensure that most such claims, whether relating to advance procurement and training, or decisions on the ground, will be doomed to failure.\n",
              "On the other hand, the pleaded claims in the present cases go further.\n",
              "It is alleged, as I understand, that there was an unjustified failure, following earlier incidents, to take readily available steps to deal with a known and preventable risk.\n",
              "I would not regard such claims as necessarily excluded as a matter of general policy, either at common law or under article 2.\n",
              "Since all the issues will now have to be considered at trial, it is unnecessary and probably undesirable for me to say more.</td>\n",

              "The claimants all claim that the MoD breached the implied positive obligation in article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention) to take preventive measures to protect life in the light of the real and immediate risk to life of soldiers who were required to patrol in Snatch Land Rovers.\n",
              "The third (the Ellis negligence claim) is brought by Courtney Ellis in negligence and is based on various alleged failures on the part of the MoD [1 12].\n",
              "The MoD argued that the Snatch Land Rover claims under article 2 of the Convention should be struck out because at the time of their deaths Pte Hewett and Pte Ellis were not within the jurisdiction of the UK for the purposes of the Convention, and because on the facts as pleaded the MoD did not owe a duty to them at the time of their deaths under article 2.\n",
              "It also argued that the Challenger claims and the Ellis negligence claim should all be struck out (1) on the principle of combat immunity (which operates to exclude liability for negligence in respect of the acts or omissions of those engaged in active operations against the enemy), and (2) because it would not be fair, just or reasonable to impose a duty of care on the MoD in the circumstances of those cases [13].\n",
              "The High Court and Court of Appeal considered these arguments.\n",
              "The effect of the Court of Appeals judgment was that: (1) the Snatch Land Rover claims under article 2 of the Convention should be struck out because the deceased were outside the jurisdiction of the UK for the purposes of the Convention and there was no basis for extra territorial jurisdiction; and (2) the Challenger claims and the Ellis negligence claim should proceed to trial [15].\n",
              "The following issues were before the Supreme Court. (1) In relation to the Snatch Land Rover claims, whether at the time of their deaths Pte Hewett and Pte Ellis were within the jurisdiction of the UK for the purposes of the Convention. (2) If they were, whether and if so, the extent to which article 2 imposes positive obligations on the UK with a view to preventing the deaths of its own soldiers in active operations against the enemy. (3) In relation to the Challenger claims and the Ellis negligence claim, whether the allegations of negligence should be struck out because they fall within the scope of combat immunity or because it would not be fair, just or reasonable to impose a duty to take care to protect against death or injury in the circumstances [16].\n",
              "The Court unanimously holds that, in relation to the Snatch Land Rover claims, Pte Hewett and Pte Ellis were within the UKs jurisdiction for the purposes of the Convention at the time of their deaths.\n",
              "By a majority (Lords Mance, Wilson and Carnwath dissenting), the Court holds that: (i) the Snatch Land Rover claims should not be struck out on the ground that the claims are not within the scope of article 2 of the Convention; and (ii) the Challenger claims and Ellis negligence claim should not be struck out on the ground of combat immunity or on the ground that it would not be fair, just or reasonable to extend the MoDs duty of care to those cases [101].\n",
              "The effect of the Courts decision is that all three sets of claims may proceed to trial.\n",
              "Issue 1: Convention jurisdiction: In its judgment of July 2011 in the Al Skeini case, the European Court of Human Rights decided that six Iraqi civilians who had died as a result of the actions of British armed forces in Iraq were within the UKs jurisdiction for the purposes of the Convention.\n",
              "The judgment does not answer issue 1 directly, but elements can be extracted from it which point clearly to the conclusion that the Court reaches in this case.\n",
              "It formulates a relatively general principle that extra territorial jurisdiction can exist whenever a state through its agents exercises authority and control over an individual.\n",
              "It also indicated that Convention rights can be divided and tailored to the particular circumstances of the extra territorial act in question, as opposed to being an indivisible package.\n",
              "A states extra territorial jurisdiction over local inhabitants exists because of the authority and control that is exercised over them as a result of the authority and control that the state has over its own armed forces.\n",
              "They are all brought within the states jurisdiction by the application of the same general principle [42 52].\n",
              "Issue 2: Snatch Land Rover claims under article 2 of the Convention: In this area, the court must fully recognise the wide margin of appreciation to be given to the state and avoid imposing obligations which are unrealistic or disproportionate.\n",
              "But it must give effect to those obligations where it would be reasonable to expect the individual to be protected by article 2.\n",
              "Policy decisions made at a high level of command and things done on the battlefield will fall outside the scope of article 2.\n",

              "Issue 3: Challenger claims and Ellis negligence claim: The doctrine of combat immunity should be construed narrowly and should not be extended beyond its established scope to the planning of and preparation for active operations against the enemy.\n",
              "The Challenger claims are not within the scope of the doctrine because they relate to decisions which are sufficiently far removed from the pressures and risks of active operations against the enemy.\n",
              "The Ellis negligence claim is less obviously directed to things done away from the theatre of battle so it is arguably within the doctrine.\n",
              "It would be premature for these claims to be struck out and the issue should be open to further argument in the light of the evidence [89 96].\n",
              "The circumstances in which active operations are undertaken by the UKs armed services today vary greatly and cannot all be grouped under a single umbrella as if they were all open to the same risk of judicialising warfare.\n",

              "For the same reasons, Lord Carnwath would have struck out the Challenger claims.\n",
